COVID-19 Coronavirus: Customer update
COVID-19 Coronavirus: Customer update
We are all constantly adapting to the impacts related to COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as the situation continues to rapidly evolve, requiring us to review new information and respond accordingly each day in order to keep our employees, customers, partners, and communities safe.
We want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to allow you to continue business as usual.  One of Megger’s greatest strengths is our people, who are committed to providing our customers with the service and support that they need to maintain the reliability of their power systems and critical assets.
Megger has enforced travel restrictions for our employees, and we understand many of our customers also have such restrictions in place. Additionally, all our employees that are able to work remotely have been advised to work from home. This is to protect our manufacturing facilities and we are thankful to report, as the situation currently stands, we are able to keep our manufacturing sites fully operational. Where possible, inventories have been increased and additional logistics planned in the hope that this will minimise any disruption to our customers.
Sales support:
At this point all our offices remain open and provisions have been made to continue support should locations become infected. Sales teams that are unable to visit remain at your disposal through the phone, email and video conferencing.
Technical Support
: In addition to the normal channels, which remain open, we have further invested in video conferencing capabilities to offer demonstrations and problem resolution as best we can.  We are also providing an additional series of webinars which will be published shortly. There are additional materials online and by registering we can meet your specific needs such as advise of software updates, free extended warranty and technical information.
Repairs and Service:
Our repair services continue to work as normal, both through our own facilities and the global network of Authorised Service Centres.
Delivery of products:
We are experiencing some delays to raw materials causing alterations to production schedules, but to date delays are minor. We have provided additional storage locations and added inventory to the supply chain. At present, delivery of products to end-users and distribution partners are unaffected at this time.
We appreciate your understanding that the situation may change at any given moment as we receive more updates from local governments. Know that we will continue to do our best to support you in keeping your electricity supply networks up and running and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
