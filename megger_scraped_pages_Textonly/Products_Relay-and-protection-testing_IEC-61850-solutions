IEC 61850 solutions
IEC 61850 solutions
I
n modern
digital substations
, the IED’s are connected through an IT network where the communication is digital and follows the IEC 61850 standard, an international standard where Megger has been contributing to its evolution since Edition 1. The primary data is also digitised through merging units and published as Sampled Values at a network called process bus.
These IEC 61850 networks require specialised solutions to effectively verify that the substation is properly configurated and Megger has been providing such since 2009. For example, to capture the current data traffic and compare that with the specified and authorised data traffic helps to identify potential problems and in worst case, unauthorised data traffic by intruders.
Order information
Once you select your preferred single or multi-function
relay protection
tester, make sure you include the GOOSE and Sampled Values pin in your package. To do this, please write the correct number in the internal software option.
IEC 61850 Hardware solutions
The test equipment is the hardware of the test system and interfaces with the IEC 61850 network. The display models have all testing capabilities onboard.
