Frequently asked questions
PAT testing
PAT testing
Can I prevent the printer from cutting an extra piece of blank label?
Unfortunately, this is a quirk of the printer which cannot be adjusted.
Can I test 3-phase equipment?
Yes. By purchasing a 3 phase adaptor lead, insulation and earth bond tests can be performed.
Does my PAT need appliance testing?
No. It meets strict safety requirements specific to electrical test equipment and is used by competent persons with training in electrical safety.
How can I keep the size of printed labels to a minimum?
We recommend the Asset ID be kept to no more than 5-6 digits. Extra info can be added to the description if necessary.
How can I test 110V appliances?
Note: Use the correct method for your PAT tester model.

PAT300 & 400 series
Plug PAT into 110V supply using adaptor.

PAT4
Plug PAT 4 into 110V supply using adaptor.

PAT32
PAT 32 just 230V supply but plug appliance into 110V socket.
How do I know if it is a Class I and Class II item?
Class I has an earth so likely to have an earth pin in the plug and a metal casing. Class II is doubled insulated
. Will have the following symbol on the information plate:
How do I reset my PAT?
Note: Use the correct method for your PAT tester model.

PAT300 & 400 series
Hold down the test button while tester switches on and select reset.
Warning: Back up data before resetting as data may be deleted.

PAT4 & PAT32
Hold down the ‘R’ button while switching the tester on and select reset.
Warning: Back up data before resetting as data may be deleted.
How do I set the printer up?
PAT4 & PAT32 only
Hold down ‘P’ on switch on and select required printer.
How do I test a FELV laptop charger?
Only a visual test can be made on ITE though the detachable 3 core mains supply lead should be tested separately as a standard IEC lead. A bond test should not be performed on the metal part of the laptop plug as this may damage the charger. For more info see our application note, PAT testing IT equipment (found on the PAT300/400 page under resources).
How do I test equipment with surge protection?
Surge protection will normally fail a 500 V insulation test so this should be substituted for by either an earth leakage test or a 250 V insulation test.
How do I test extension leads?
Note: Use the correct method for your PAT tester model.



PAT300 & 400 series
Use the IEC lead to plug into the extension lead and the other end back into PAT in the IEC socket. For multi-socket leads, perform an earth bond test for each socket.

PAT4
Need to use an IEC lead to plug into the extension lead and the other end back into PAT4 in socket labelled “Lead Test”

PAT32
Use ELT1 to plug into extension lead and plug the extension lead into tester. Press required test buttons.
How much can my PAT4 store?
1000 Assets
10 Clients
20 Locations

The PAT4 will display when you have reached the maximum limit. In this case the only thing to do is download the results and then reset the tester by holding down ‘R’ when switching the unit on.
How should I test IT or sensitive equipment?
Note: Use the correct method for your PAT tester model.

PAT400 series
You can use PC test group on PAT400s. Tests to be performed should be visual inspection, earth continuity, operation test and earth leakage.

PAT4
Can use PC test group on PAT4. Tests to be performed should be visual inspection and earth continuity. Can perform operations test and earth leakage with PAT4.
I can’t download to my computer; I don’t have a serial port on my computer.
You can use an adaptor (p/n 35871), Set the port number in properties of Download Manager to the same number port in Device Manager to ensure software is looking at correct port.
What is the user name & password for my PAT4?
Try AVO & 1234. If this does not work, you can look into the tester by using “CT17 9EN” for the user name. If there is data here you can download and reset the PAT.
Why does my extension lead fail the earth bond test?
Have you applied lead compensation? Long extension leads add extra resistance which needs to be allowed for. The PAT400 can calculate this for you.
Why is my PAT not performing the fast restart when in repeated use?
The battery may not have enough charge. Try leaving the PAT plugged in for a couple of hours to charge or replace the 9 V rechargeable PP3 battery. Be sure to press the red button when finished testing to prevent the battery from draining.
