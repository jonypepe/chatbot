Overview
Technical
Software
Industry leading test duration using patented simultaneous multi-tap measurements reduces testing time by 20 % on multi-tap CTs
Accuracy to support testing of metering and protection class CT
Integrated single-phase relay test system
Grouped testing: demagnetisation, knee points, ratios, saturation curves, winding resistance insulation, and more
Measure all ratios and saturation curves on multi-tap CTs with one lead connection
Optional DC excitation technique for testing CTs with knee points up to 30 kV
Optional integrated VT and CT test system
The Megger MRCT relay and current transformer test set is a lightweight, robust, portable unit used to perform demagnetisation, ratio, saturation, winding resistance, polarity, phase deviation, and insulation tests on current transformers (CTs). The MRCT automatically calculates ratio errors, saturation curves, and knee points and provides a microprocessor-controlled variable voltage and current output and precision instrumentation for automatically testing single and multi-ratio CTs, reducing testing time and increasing productivity. The MRCT will directly connect to multi-ratio CT’s and perform all tests – saturation, ratio, polarity, winding resistance, and insulation – on all taps with the push of a button and without changing leads.
The MRCT can be controlled via Megger’s Smart Touch View Interface (STVI) controller, a full colour, high resolution, LCD touch screen which allows you to perform manual and automatic testing quickly and easily, and you can use the pre-constructed test routines to make testing even easier. The large display on the instrument enables you to easily read all pertinent data while the test is being performed and gives you ability to view the current transformer’s saturation curve. The unit can also be configured to come without a Megger STVI and can be controlled via a laptop with Megger’s PowerDB software.
Using the MRCT, current transformers can be tested in their equipment configuration, such as being mounted in transformers, oil circuit breakers, or switchgears. It is necessary for the equipment to be completely isolated from the electrical system prior to testing.
