Overview
Technical
6000 count backlit digital display
True RMS reading on AC mode
1000 V DC/750 V AC ranges
10 A AC/DC ranges
Resistance, frequency, and capacitance ranges
CAT IV 600 V safety rating
The AVO410 TRMS digital multimeter has been designed for the contracting electrician however, its additional features also make the instrument suitable for wide range of applications and users. Indeed, the AVO410 offers both AC and DC voltage and current measurements as well as resistance, frequency, and capacitance ranges. It is also capable of true RMS readings on AC functions and has a CATIV 600 V safety rating, making it suitable for industrial applications. To that end, its slim, compact case has a tough rubber holster, giving it extra protection from the extreme conditions found in industrial environments.
The style of the case and positioning of the function switch and buttons means the unit sits comfortably in your palm for single-handed use and it's intuitive functions make it easy to use without constant reference to the user guide.
Additionally, the AVO410's display features a back light that allows measurements to be made in poorly lit areas and it comes supplied with a silicon cable and GS38 compliant shrouded tips on the prods.
