Overview
Technical
Software
Powered off of phase A voltage AC/DC
Weatherproof to IP54 standard for use in any environment
1000 VAC and 1500 VDC range
Auto CT identifies the current that the instrument is connected to and the range that it is in
Connection verification highlights if the product has been connected incorrectly
On-board data analysis which can compare results against compliance standards, including setting templates for internal company standards
Real time scope and DVM
IEC61000-4-30 Class A compliance
The MPQ2000 portable power quality analyser is a highly intuitive, advanced, portable three-phase analyser, delivering unmatched capability, in a rugged IP54 weatherproof enclosure. You can view RMS data, waveforms, demand data, phase angles, harmonics, unbalance, flicker, and more in real time with the MPQ1000 scope mode and DVM mode. When data needs to be recorded, the MPQ2000 record verification will automatically identify the current clamps, recognise their range, and verify the unit is connected properly. This means you can simply connect it and push the record button.
But the hardware is not all it’s about – behind the sturdy exterior is an intelligence that is focused on smart testing, with industry-leading software that enables you to minimise errors while testing, and quickly and easily analyse your results. The MPQ2000 can record for extended periods of time because of its massive memory. It uses an SD card, which makes expanding the memory as easy as simply installing a new SD card. The recorded data can be viewed on the MPQ2000 colour VGA display, or the data can be transferred to the high power Megger PQ Power Quality Analysis software via USB cable, USB drive, Ethernet, or directly from the SD card.
The free software, which requires no license, optimises the MPQ2000 to locate the power quality phenomenon such as lighting issues, computer problems, tripping breakers, and much more. It offers advanced charting, advanced waveform, and advanced harmonic analysis.

Megger PQ Firmware for MPQ Series PQ Analysers
The new MPQ firmware version 1.421 allows the MPQ to reboot after a hard error condition and has the proper TDD scaling. It contains all  improvements and bug fixes of the previous update.
MPQ firmware version 1.407 firmware and application code 1.1.0.44 supports both the MPQ1000 and MPQ2000. It incorporates the following bug fixes and software enhancements.
Bug Fixes
The MPQ now auto detects the 20A and 10CT ranges.
The scope mode now recognizes the CT range.
The 4 wire 2.5 wattmeter calculation has been corrected.
Auto Analysis now functioning with larger files.
The MPQ has corrected TDD scaling.
The MPQ now reboots properly after a hard error condition.
Enhancements
New On Board Setup: Update the setups on the front panel of the MPQ. From the DMM screen scroll to SETUP and press the ENTER key to access the new setup screens.
New AUTO mode: The MPQ will now measures the voltage & frequency and automatically set the appropriate limits. Simply connect the MPQ, select the setup configuration & start recording. The MPQ does everything else.
Unlimited Recording Time: The MPQ Analyzer will record data files up to 100M. When the data file reaches 100M it will automatically start a new data file. It will record until the 32G card is full. This means the unit can record for literally year’s non-stop. Record inrush on motors for days or weeks.
Remote monitoring time sync: The MPQ Analyzer can automatically time sync to your network periodically. No need to pay extra for GPS then to just worry about losing the signal. Keep all the units on the network perfectly synced.
CT Prompt added to preferences screen. If CT prompt is enabled then the analyzer will display a warning message if the CT range does not match the range programmed in the setup file. If the CT prompt is disabled then the analyzer will automatically use the auto identified CT range and dislay no message.
When connected to a 3 phase wye the unit will now display both the phase to neutral values as well as the phase to phase values.
Calculated 3rd Phase: When the MPQ is connected to a delta it will automatically calculate the 3rd phase values. The MPQ will also allow the user to view the Delta as a wye. This means you can view both the phase relationships within the delta and the phase relationships to the load.
Download and Install instructions
Please download the Executable file “MPQUpdateMaker_BF_MPQ_MPQCD_RebootLed_1_421.exe” to a workstation where the installer can transfer the files and folder structure to a preferably blank USB Thumb Drive with at least 8 MB of available space and that does not have a MEGGER folder at its root.
With the Thumb Drive installed into the workstation, execute the downloaded file which will locate all installed removable media and display it.
Choose the thumb drive to be used for updating the MPQ equipment and then proceed with the installation.
After the installation completes, please eject the thumb drive which is now ready to use with the MPQ1000 or MPQ2000 instruments to be updated.
