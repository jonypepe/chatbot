Electrical Tester Magazine - March 2020
Explore our first issue of
ET magazine
, online. Inside you’ll find our feature article that discusses the coordinated efforts that will be required to successfully merge the electrified transportation sector with the electric utility sector, sharing the latest thinking, research and challenges ahead.
Transformer testers/engineers will appreciate learning how several variables may unknowingly affect your TTR test results. A bird’s-eye view of the rise of transformer electrical, dielectric testing provides an overview of the tests necessary to fully assess a transformer’s dielectric health.
As a necessary test to detect inter-turn insulation breakdown – one of the most common early initiators of motor faults, Motor insulation test voltages: How high is too high? dispels myths surrounding surge testing. The missing link in motor condition monitoring makes the case for electrical tests as vital requirements for achieving plant reliability – not just tests that detect mechanical problems.
Andrea Bonetti explains ROCOF protection and how to test it. He also fields some of the most frequent questions he gets asked about IEC61850 in ET’s Q&A section. DC testing of vacuum integrity in MV switchgear explains the advantage of using DC over AC to test vacuum and the importance of the ‘DC’ your test instrument delivers. Marius Averitai discusses the choice of using primary or secondary injection to test a relay protection system; why, in many cases, primary injection is better; and important features in a primary injection test set.
