Checks charger condition by measuring AC ripple current
Includes PowerDB LITE Software
The BITE2 and BITE2P battery impedance testers determine the condition of lead-acid and nickel-cadmium cells up to 7000 Ah. An advanced feature set has been developed that includes Pass/Warning/Fail calculations based on a user-entered baseline value, advanced printing functions, and more. The BITE2P consists of both a transmitter and a carrying case for all standard accessories and some optional accessories. The BITE2 and its accessories fit into a sturdy canvas case with a shoulder strap.
The instruments work by applying a test current across the battery string while on-line, then measuring the total current (AC ripple and test current) and the voltage drop of each cell/jar. It then calculates the impedance. They also measure DC voltage and interconnection (strap) resistance to help determine the overall condition of the entire battery string's electrical path from terminal plate to terminal plate.
The BITE2 and BITE2P receiver stores the readings in its internal memory. These measurements, along with other maintenance data such as ambient and pilot cell temperatures and AC ripple current, assist in determining the overall condition of battery systems. Megger recommends that impedance measurements with the BITE2 or BITE2P be made part of a battery maintenance program with readings taken and recorded semi-annually for flooded batteries and quarterly for VRLA.
Unlike load cycle testing that involves substantial downtime and repeated discharges, using these instruments requires no battery discharge, nor does it stress the battery in any way compared to other techniques. With a test time of less than 20 seconds for each cell and intercell connector, one person can easily, quickly, and precisely measure internal cell impedance, DC terminal voltage, and intercell connection resistance without taking the battery system off-line.
Naturally, everything you need to perform these tests is included with the basic instruments. There is a full line of optional accessories to enhance the capabilities of the BITE2 and BITE2P and both have the ability to download to a PC for data interpretation. Additionally, the BITE2P has a built-in printer so you can review the active test and also leave a hard copy record at the site.
