Unique substation surveying system
Component failure in a substation has serious repercussions. It has the potential to cause injury, damage and unplanned outages, which result in significant disruption and cost. Predictive condition assessment aims to identify faults developing in electrical equipment so that they can be addressed before failure.
The UHF PD Detector is the ideal tool for quick, non-invasive surveys in MV and HV substations and should be part of the toolkit for all maintenance and service teams. Due to its high measurement bandwidth, the UHF method provides accurate local online partial discharge (PD) measurements on HV components such as cable end-terminations, surge arrestors, voltage transformers and isolators.
Show advantages of UHF as per below:
Highlights
Advantages of UHF PD measurement technology at a glance:
Online measurement
Measurement is performed online, no outage is required
MV and HV plants
Ideal for fast verification of PD activity in MV and HV plants
Sensitive PD
Allows sensitive PD measurements since frequency bands with low noise levels can be selected
Remote Assets
Localized measurement eliminating any influence
of disturbances from remote assets
Internal PD defects
Allows internal PD defects to be distinguished from corona and surface discharges
Features
Ultra-light operation
The device is operated either from the high-resolution and large, six-inch colour touch screen or with the keypad. Menus are reduced to a minimum â€“ the user only needs to concentrate on the essential information and is guided from beginning to end through the entire measuring process. The data is stored in the internal memory and can be copied to a USB stick at the end of the day for further processing / reporting.
Time-synchronous PRPD pattern
To make reliable decisions, time-synchronous PRPD patterns (phase-resolved partial discharge) are obligatory.
The UHF PD Detector can be synchronized with the power frequency by means of a number of methods. This ensures that the exact PRPD pattern can be obtained and that synchronous noise can be easily distinguished from partial discharges so that no unwanted false decisions are made.
Two channels
Another technical highlight of the UHF PD Detector are the two input channels. This allows the user to compare
several sensors, or phases, at the same time. Typical examples could be the comparison of HV terminations which have pre-installed UHF Sensors as shown on the image. Furthermore this feature is also very useful for PD localisation via level comparison in GIS switchgear using the internal UHF sensors. Summarized this capability further increases the functionality of the UHF PD Detector and makes it a unique, efficient and reliable measurement system.
Sensor diversity
Due to the large number of compatible sensors, both MV and HV plants can be tested with the UHF PD Detector. In addition to this, the UHF PD Detector has the unique advantage that both RF and UHF measurement functions are combined in one single measuring instrument.

Partial discharges emanating from the most diverse components of MV and HV systems, such as cable terminations, surge arresters, voltage and current transformers, switchgear and insulators, can be therefore be identified. In addition the UHF PD Detector can also be used with UHF sensors from other suppliers like drain valve sensors for transformers or UHF sensors within GIS.
