SA
Motor protection​
Almost all industries use motors and these require unique functions to ensure they have sufficient protection. Furthermore, it is critical that a trip happens during normal operation so the process isn’t interrupted.
SA
Generation protection​
In all parts of the network, there are a few fundamental protection schemes which are used to protect the network, i.e., overcurrent and overvoltage.

Generation protection​
In all parts of the network, there are a few fundamental protection schemes which are used to protect the network, i.e., overcurrent and overvoltage.
SA
Transformer protection​
The power transformer is the most valuable asset in the substation and therefore rigorous protections schemes have been developed to both protect it and to keep the network up and running.
SA
Busbar protection​
The busbar is the extension cord of the substation where the energy is distributed to several different branches. The protection of this can be complex.
DER
Distributed Energy Resources - Wind
Large-scale wind farms, off-shore and on-shore, are connected at medium voltage levels to the grid and their protection is relatively straightforward. However Self-powered relays are common in this area and create unique testing challenges.

DER
Distributed Energy Resources - Solar
The protection functions of solar farms may seem simple, however they must be well maintained in order to ensure that they are at optimal functionality. Tests focused on frequency, following the IEC 60255-181 standard, are crucial.

Power Generation Protection​ - Nuclear
In nuclear power plants, there are many aspects to consider for a preventive maintenance program. Specifically those related to environmental safety, and those that ensure a stable network; both aspects make protection schemes rather complex.

Power Generation Protection - Hydro
In large-scale generating stations such as hydropower, large assets are high in cost and very important for the supply and stability of the power grid. This why reasons keeping them well protected is of utmost importance.

Digital Substation
Software, data communication and control, etc., is standard in modern substations. Though the development and implementation of IEC 61850 since mid 2000’s, the way to design, configure and run the substations have changed. This IT influence brings many advantages but also introduce new challenges to the industry.
Distributed energy resources
The power network is facing a huge change moving from centralized, large generation stations to smaller DER. Accurate communication leading to quick and correct decisions will be key in the development of the smart grid. The relay protection in DERs, like wind and solar farms, uses rather basic protection functions but their design creates other challenges when it comes to testing.
Special and advanced applications
Advanced relay testing refer to protection functions that isn’t straight forward parameters such as current, voltage or frequency. Even though that is exactly what is measured and calculated, the advanced protection category is either presented in another format, such as impedance for distance protection, or require complex test setup as transformer differential.

Digital Substation
In modern digital substations, the IEDs and instrument transformer merging units are connected through data networks. The information sent in these networks follows the IEC 61850 standard, an international standard that Megger, as a thought leader, has been contributing to since Edition 1. IEC 61850 networks require specialised solutions to effectively verify that the substation is properly configurated, and Megger has been providing such solutions since 2009.

Megger is by your side to meet all power grid challenges
As the power grid is a corner stone of modern society, the need for selective, quick, and reliable disconnection when faults occur is essential. The purpose of protective relay equipment is to sense fault states and trip circuit breakers. If a fault isn’t disconnected quickly, personal injuries and damage to circuits and equipment can occur with significant direct and indirect costs. At the same time, as these decisions sometimes need to be taken within a thousandth of a second, it is necessary identify and isolate only the faulty part of the network to minimise customer impact.
Our power protection test solutions make complex tasks simpler by providing precise and specific products, enabling fast and easy quality assurance. Thanks to our well-recognised and extensive experience in software, data communication, and control of modern substations, our products and expert support will give you confidence that your assets are well protected. Megger is your key partner to take informed decisions over the protection of the power network.
