Power, Distribution & Instrument Transformers
Partial discharge measurements on power and distribution transformers are a proven tool to identify and locate insulation defects within windings, instrument transformers, bushings, tap changers, or other accessories. Besides providing the required equipment for
factory acceptance testing
(FAT), Power Diagnostix offers a wide range of instruments for
onsite investigations
and for
continuous online monitoring
