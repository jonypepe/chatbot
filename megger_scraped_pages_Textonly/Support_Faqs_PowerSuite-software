My NICEIC certificate is only printing out the text/numbers and not printing the background
This is when a Computer Friendly (CF) certificate has been created and not a Plain Paper (PP) one. Computer friendly certificates are used when you have pre printed templates bought from the NIC. Plain paper certificates simply print the whole certificate on to plain paper.
My PAT4 won’t download
There may be a few reasons for your PAT4 not downloading, these include:
COM port set incorrectly; make sure that the COM port in the PAT4 properties within Download Manager matches the COM port number found in device manager under ‘Ports (COM & LPT)’.
An incorrect serial cable is being used; make sure you are using the cross over serial cable that came with the PAT tester.
The RS232 to USB adaptor you are using is not compatible with your operating system. Check the specification of the adaptor.
What do the codes represent for the NICEIC certificates?
An NICEIC A1 Certificate abbreviation reference list can be downloaded from the following

What version of PowerSuite do I need?
When I open download manager it asks “Set CSV Viewer as default association?” what does this mean?
CSV viewer is a programme built into Download Manager that is used to view your downloaded results. If you do not use CSV files for anything else other than downloading from your tester then we would suggest saying ‘Yes’ to this prompt.
When I try and update is says “error occurred in the move data process” what does this mean?
The cause of this error is usually down to PowerSuite still running in the background or a third party piece of software blocking the installation.
When I try to start PowerSuite it says “data registry is read only” what does this mean?
This error is usually caused by user permissions. Make sure you are logged in as an administrator if this is the first time installing the software.  If you have been able to use the software in the past then it’s possible your user permissions have been changed.
