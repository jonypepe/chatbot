Overview
Technical
Software
Determines health of lead-acid cells up to 2000 Ah
On-line testing with Pass/Warning/Fail calculations
Measures impedance, interconnection resistance, and cell voltage
Windows CE operating system with 32 MB of memory
Measures float and ripple currents
Includes PowerDB LITE Management Software
The BITE3 battery impedance tester determines the health of lead-acid cells up to 2000 Ah by taking measurements of the most important battery parameters. The BITE3 measures cell impedance, an internal ohmic test, cell voltage, intercell connection resistance, and ripple current. What's more, for the first time in a battery instrument, the BITE3 measures float current and the harmonic content of the ripple current. There is even a built-in spectrum analyser to show the harmonic content of the ripple current. It has firmware that can be upgraded through the Internet and supports multiple languages.
The BITE3 is one of the easiest instruments to use. Its measurements, along with temperature, specific gravity and other battery data, can provide the best basis for evaluating the overall health of batteries from terminal plate to terminal plate and, to a lesser extent, the charger (from ripple current and its harmonic content). Megger recommends that the BITE3 be made part of a comprehensive battery maintenance program with readings taken and recorded semi-annually for flooded lead-acid cells, and quarterly for VRLA.
The BITE3 is quick, reliable, and easy to use. With a rapid test time, one person can easily, quickly, and precisely measure cell and string parameters without taking the system off-line.

Updating BITE3 Firmware with Power DB LITE

BITE 3
The BITE3 is fully supported by the PowerDB Software. The PowerDB Lite software is provided at no charge and can be downloaded from this web site. However, if you choose not to utilize PowerDB Lite for your data maintenance and analysis needs, a Microsoft Excel template file is provided below that will allow you to upload test data in the BITE3 to the spreadsheet. Once the data is uploaded to the spreadsheet, you are free to use any tool in the Microsoft Office suite to analyze, archive, and/or export your data. We have noted that some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer rename the update file to a dot zip file extension (.zip). Mozzila FireFox works correctly leaving the file extension as "dot update" (.update). If this happens to you, please modify the file extension from (.zip) back to (.update) before saving. Thank you for your understanding.
BITE 3 Updates Since it's original release, the BITE 3 has seen 3 different variations of processor board. This complicates the update process just a bit. Before downloading an update, please turn on your instrument and navigate the menus to "System", "About". The first entry is Version. The First field of the Version of you instrument must agree with first field of the download version. i.e. Your instrument currently is at Version 3.0.1.1 then you would use update "Firmware 3.0.1.2". The download file will have the name "BITE3.3.0.1.2.update". Each update begins with "BITE3" a period and the update version number in this case "3.0.1.2" a final period and the word "update".
Save the download to a place that you will be able to easily navigate to. Then use PowerDB to update the BITE3.
For more information, please contact Andy Sagl (
Andrew.Sagl@megger.com
) at Megger Valley Forge at 610-676-8528. PowerDB software for the PC now supports BITE 3.
