Overview
Technical
Software
Used for testing single phase power and distribution transformers
Design based on precision bridge measuring technique
Unmatched accuracy (±0.1 %) in a portable design
The Single-phase, hand-cranked TTR transformer turns ratio test set measures the turns ratio and exciting current of windings in power, potential and current transformers (PTs and CTs). Deviations in turns ratio readings indicate problems in one or both windings or the magnetic core circuit.
The single-phase model is primarily used for testing single-phase power and distribution transformers and can measure highly sensitive turns ratios of up to 129.99:1 with unmatched accuracy of ±0.1 %. An optional auxilary transformer extends the ratio range to 329.99:1. It can also be used to test three-phase transformers by connecting and testing each phase separately.
The TTR test set aids in identifying shorted coils, open circuits, incorrect connections, and internal faults or tap-changer defects in step regulators as well as in transformers. It operates on the principle that the voltage ratio of the transformer at no load is practically equal to the true turns ratio. The TTR comes in a portable design and packaged in a rugged, compact case.
