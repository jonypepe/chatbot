Renewables Wind Power Season
Renewables Wind Power Season
Wind power is an increasingly popular technology that is solving energy demands in every country around the world. Its constant technological developments are adding significant technical challenges to testing engineers and maintenance teams. Therefore, it's crucial to continually update your knowledge on the latest industry trends, understand the latest testing techniques, and the important role of industry standards.
Our Wind Power Webinar series is designed to provide comprehensive knowledge and support on this subject. Eight hot topics have been presented by experts from Megger around the world in the form of webinars; each session covers standards, examples, techniques, case studies, and includes a live Q&A session with the audience.
