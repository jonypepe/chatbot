Episode 1 - Digital Substations
Exploring the topic of digital substation, the practicalities of testing and what the future might hold.
Watch now
Episode 2 - Insulation testing and asset management
Insulation testing may be a fundamental of asset management, however its importance is sometimes undervalued. This episode looks at insulation testing and why it's one of the ultimate tests in the electrical industry.
Watch now
Episode 3 - Making the most of industrial downtime
Unplanned downtime can be a huge loss from an asset perspective. This episode looks into how we can reduce this and avoid unwanted downtime.
Watch now
Episode 4 - The 1Hz revolution
One small thing could make a huge difference when it comes to transformer integrity, and that is 1Hz. This episode looks into how 1Hz can be used to give you the ultimate confidence when testing transformers.
Watch now
Episode 5 - How to maintain transformer integrity
Maintaining integrity of an asset is key to avoiding unplanned downtime. In this episode we dive into the complexities of making sure transformers are operating at maximum efficiency.
Watch now
Episode 6 - The future of protection: Digital Twin
When it comes to the electrical industry, we're always looking to what the future might hold. In this episode Niclas Wetterstrand takes us on a journey into the future of substations with the rise of "Digital Twins"
