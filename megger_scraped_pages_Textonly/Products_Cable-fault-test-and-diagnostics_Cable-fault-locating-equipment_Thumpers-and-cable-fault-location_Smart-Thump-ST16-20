The Smart Thump ST16-20 portable/vehicle-mounted cable fault locating system provides a safe, efficient, and extremely easy-to-use solution for quickly identifying, pre-locating, and pinpointing various types of cable faults for power cables. The ST16-20 has been developed to meet the requirements for typical medium voltage distribution cable fault location markets from 11 to 35 kV system voltage.
The ST16-20 unit incorporates “E-Tray” technology, an automatic test sequence that helps proof test, pre-locate, and pinpoint faults. This feature has already proven beneficial in other Megger products, such as the EZ-Thump, EZ-Restore Overdrive, and TDR T3090, and will continue to be used in future products.
This unit is ideal for operations departments of power utility companies, electrical departments within municipalities, private network operators, high voltage electrical contractors, service companies, port authorities, mining, airports, military bases, petrochemical companies, and paper companies.
