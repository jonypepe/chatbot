Overview
Technical
Software
Small, rugged, lightweight, and powerful
Operate with or without a computer
4 voltage channels, 3 current channels
Integrated Smart Touch View Interface (STVI)
High current output - 45 Amps at 300 VARMS per phase
Dynamic, transient, and GPS satellite-synchronised end-to-end testing abilities
IEC 61850 testing capabilities
The SMRT43D multi-phase relay test system is a lightweight, field portable test set capable of testing a wide variety of electromechanical, solid state, and microprocessor-based protective relays, motor overload relays, and similar protective devices.
The SMRT43D has the ability to be controlled with its built-in Smart Touch View Interface (STVI). The STVI is Megger’s second generation of automatic/semi-automatic manual user interface software. With its large, full colour, high resolution, TFT LCD touch screen, it allows you to perform manual, steady-state, and dynamic testing quickly and easily using the manual test screen, as well as using built-in preset test routines for most popular relays. The STVI displays metered values such as AC and DC Amperes, AC and DC Volts, and time in both seconds and cycles. Depending on the type of test selected, other values may be displayed, such as phase angle, frequency, ohms, watts, VA, or power factor/dissipation factor. Menu screens and touch screen function buttons are provided to quickly and easily select the desired test function. Tests results can be saved to the STVI for download to a USB drive to transfer or print test reports.
The test system may also be customised by adding the number of voltage-current modules, called VIGEN modules, needed for specific test applications with a maximum of three channels. For example, the SMRT43D with three VIGEN Modules provides complete three-phase testing of three-phase impedance, directional power, negative sequence overcurrent and other devices that require a three-phase four-wire wye connected sources. The fourth voltage channel provides a synchronising reference voltage or can serve as a battery simulator.
For full automatic testing, the SMRT43D can also be placed under full computer control via the Relay Test Management Software (RTMS) running on a PC. RTMS is a Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 compatible software program designed to manage all aspects of protective relay testing using the Megger SMRT43D.
