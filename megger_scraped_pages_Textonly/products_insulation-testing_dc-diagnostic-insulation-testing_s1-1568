Overview
Technical
Software
Resistance measurement up to 35 TΩ with 8 mA noise rejection plus 4 filters
Proven ability to make accurate stable measurements in noisy environments such as 765 kV substations
Rapid charge of capacitive loads such as high voltage power cables
Additional safety in high energy locations with remote operation
Rapid charge Li-ion battery (meets IEC62133)
Operate with flat battery from an AC source
Tough dual-case design to survive harsh environments
The S1-1568 15 kV insulation resistance tester has been designed, specified and tested to meet the stringent requirements of power utilities. In addition to being a tough, high performance insulation tester, the S1-1568 offers the ability to perform accurate insulation resistance measurements in extreme, high noise environments, rapid charging of cable capacitance, and even remote operation for both convenience and safety.
With class-leading noise rejection of 8 mA – twice that of most comparable instruments – and enhanced software filtering that has four user-selectable options, Megger’s S1 series of 5 kV, 10 kV and 15 kV DC insulation resistance testers deliver dependable results in even the most severe of electrical environments, including high voltage transmission and distribution substations.
Other innovative features include provision for remote control via a fully isolated USB port, which makes the instruments ideally suited for use in production environments, and internal storage for date- and time-stamped results. Stored results can be recalled to the display, downloaded via a Bluetooth wireless link, or accessed via the USB port.
Compact and lightweight, the S1 insulation resistance testers feature a tough dual-case design and, with the lid closed, they have an IP65 ingress protection rating. They offer timed insulation resistance (IR), dielectric absorption ratio (DAR), polarisation index (PI), dielectric discharge (DD), step voltage (SV) and ramp diagnostic tests, and also have a dedicated voltmeter function.
To ensure that testing is never delayed through lack of power, S1 insulation testers incorporate rapid-charge Li-ion batteries. This gives up to 4.5 hours for the S1-1568. With just 30 minutes of charging from flat, the batteries give around one hour of testing time, and it’s also possible to operate the instrument from an AC supply even if the battery is completely flat.
All S1 models have a high short-circuit current of 6 mA to ensure rapid charging of items under test and the S1-1568 has a CAT IV 1000 V safety rating at altitudes up to 4000 m, in line with IEC 61010.
