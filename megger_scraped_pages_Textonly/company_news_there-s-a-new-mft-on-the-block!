There's a new MFT on the block!
There's a new MFT on the block!
In response to the fast changing needs of today’s electrical contractors, Megger has launched the new MFT range of multifunction installation testers. These combine the highest levels of safety with ease of use, exceptional versatility and outstanding value for money. All models in the new range have valuable extra functions that have been carefully selected to make life easier and more convenient for users.
To meet the requirements and budget of every electrical contractor, Megger’s new multifunction testers are available in three versions. The MFT1711 is a cost-effective choice for routine installation testing and includes advanced features like automatic RCD testing and true RMS voltage measurement that were previously only available on more costly instruments.
The MFT1721 is an excellent option for contractors whose work includes three-phase systems and solar power installations, while maximum versatility and convenience is provided by the top-of-the-range MFT1731. This not only has advanced facilities for measuring earth resistance but also internal memory for storing test results and support for convenient Bluetooth downloading.
The new MFT1711, like all of the other instruments in the range, completely satisfies the requirements of the IET Wiring Regulations for testing low-voltage electrical installations, as well as offering many other functions. In addition to true RMS voltage measurement and facilities for automatic RCD testing, it has a 1,000 V insulation test option and a handy timesaving automatic Zmax function. It can test 10 mA, 30 mA, 100 mA, 300 mA and 500 mA RCDs and, for types with intermediate sensitivities, it also has a variable RCD test facility.
The three-phase enabled MFT1721 provides all of the functions available on the MFT1711, but additionally has a 100 V insulation test option, a millivolt sensor input and support for testing Type B RCDs. It allows phase rotation to be checked, and it can test three-phase RCDs even when no neutral is available. Phase-to-phase loop testing at 415 V can be performed, along with evaluation of prospective short-circuit current (PSCC) values of up to 20 kA.
Shipped as standard in a large soft carrying case, the MFT1731 builds on the capabilities of the MFT1721 by adding support for three-pole ART earth resistance measurements, with a clamp option, and stakeless twin-clamp earth resistance measurements. This model also has internal storage for test results with wireless downloading to smartphones, tablets and other Bluetooth-equipped devices.
All of the multifunction installation testers in Megger’s new range incorporate the qualities that have made the previous MFT1700-series instruments so popular and successful. These include a straightforward user interface for fast easy operation, robust construction to withstand the knocks and tumbles of everyday use, comprehensive electrical protection, and an extensive range of safety features, including a CAT IV 300 V/CAT III 600 V safety rating in line with IEC 61010.
