Megger's new TDR ends near-end problems
Megger's new TDR ends near-end problems
With Megger's new handheld TDR1000/3 time domain reflectometer, locating near-end faults in voice and data communications networks is no longer a problem. By using launch pulses with durations as short as 2 ns, this innovative instrument can accurately determine the location of faults that are less than a metre from the point of connection.
Simple operation
Auoto set-up for instant use
Ultra fast pulse for near-end fault identification
Trace hold feature to allow comparison between cables
IP54 rating offers real-life working
Designed for use on all metallic cable pairs
Auto set up makes it easy for the inexperienced
The TDR1000/3 incorporates an auto set-up feature that automatically determines the impedance of the cable under test and sets the instrument accordingly, and also automatically selects the optimum gain and pulse width according to the range chosen by the operator. Auto set-up makes it easy for even inexperienced users to obtain good results, and is also a big time saver for experienced users. Despite its compact construction, the TDR1000/3 incorporates a large high-resolution back-lit display. This makes it easy to analyse the traces and to accurately position the cursors, two of which are provided to give users full control and to provide instant indication of the distance between two points.
Trace hold allows trace comparison
A further key benefit is a trace hold function, which allows comparisons to be readily made between cables; the trace for the first cable is held on the display, and is then overlaid by the trace for next cable tested. This invaluable comparison function is normally only available on much larger and much more costly dual-channel TDRs. Megger's new TDR1000/3 time domain reflectometer is designed for use on all metallic cable pairs with impedances of 25 Ω, 50 Ω, 75 ? or 100 Ω and velocity factors from 0.2 to 0.99. It has user selectable ranges from 10 m to 5,000 m and, in manual operating mode, the gain for each range can be set in three user-selectable steps. The instrument features rugged yet lightweight construction and an IP54 ingress protection rating. It is powered from inexpensive and readily available AA batteries.
