The SMRT410D Megger relay test system is a multipurpose, lightweight, field portable test set capable of testing a wide variety of electromechanical, solid state, and microprocessor-based protective relays, motor overload relays, and similar protective devices. With up to 4 voltage channels and 6 high current channels, the SMRT410 meets your every testing need, providing you with a complete multi-phase test system for commissioning protection systems.
The SMRT410 VIGEN modules also provide high power in both the voltage and current channels to test virtually all types of protective relays. The SMRT410 test system may be customised by adding the number of voltage-current modules, called VIGEN modules, needed for specific test applications.
The SMRT410 test system has the ability to be manually controlled with Megger’s new Smart Touch View Interface (STVI). The STVI is Megger’s second generation of automatic/semi-automatic manual user interface software. With its large, full colour, high resolution, TFT LCD touch screen, it allows you to perform manual, steady-state, and dynamic testing quickly and easily using the manual test screen, as well as using built-in preset test routines for most popular relays. The STVI displays metered values such as AC and DC Amperes, AC and DC Volts, and time in both seconds and cycles. Depending on the type of test selected, other values may be displayed, such as phase angle, frequency, ohms, watts, VA, or power factor/dissipation factor. Menu screens and touch screen function buttons are provided to quickly and easily select the desired test function. Tests results can be saved to the STVI for download to a USB drive to transfer or print test reports.
For full automatic testing, the SMRT410 can also be placed under full computer control via the Relay Test Management Software (RTMS) running on a PC. RTMS is a Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 compatible software program designed to manage all aspects of protective relay testing using the Megger SMRT410.
