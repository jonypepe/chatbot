Overview
Technical
One button operation on 5.7 in LCD colour display
Test voltages of up to 800 kVDC
DC voltage ripple < 3 %
Automatic measuring range switchover
Motorised discharge switch
High voltage generation on both polarities optionally available
The HVDC test systems are high-performance, portable test sets that perform DC voltage tests for electrical power supply components and cables. They are suitable for all kinds of high voltage DC components in line with the applicable regulations regarding the generation of HVDC voltages of up to 800 kV. In addition, these units can also test surge arresters, HVDC transformers or insulators and can perform leakage measurements.
These effecient HVDC test systems are suitable for both installation testing in measuring trailers, and on-site testing as a stationary test set. Their modular structure makes them easy to set up on site and adaptable to various measuring tasks. Indeed, the spatial separation of the operating and high-voltage units makes it possible to operate the sets from outside the immediate danger area.
The sets are primarily designed for power supply companies, cable laying firms, service providers, cable installers, and cable manufacturers for the DC voltage testing of high voltage systems and cables. Their short-circuit-proof output circuit and high power make them suitable for use in fault location as a burn-down unit for burning high-impedance and intermittent cable fault.
