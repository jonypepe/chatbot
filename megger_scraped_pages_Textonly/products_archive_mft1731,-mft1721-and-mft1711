This latest series of multifunction installation tester adds one to the nomenclature and vastly to the value of these testers. The range of 3 instruments are expressly for testing low voltage electrical installations to BS7671. They provide all the tests required to complete the necessary electrical certification for industrial, commercial and domestic fixed wiring installations.
MFT1711
- The entry level 18th Edition tester offering CAT IV, 3 and 2-wire non trip loop testing with resistance and fault current display,frequency measurement and the largest, brightest and clearest display on the market.
This now adds a 1 kV insulation test range, Auto RCD tests, 10 mA RCD, programmable (VAR) RCD, ZMAX and true RMS voltage measurement.
MFT1721
- The most popular of the range of 18th Edition testers offering all the benefits of the MFT1710, including auto RCD testing and adding phase rotation, 3-phase RCD testing and current measurement with the optional clamp.
This now adds an additional 100V insulation test range, true RMS voltage measurement, mV sensor input and Type B RCD testing.
MFT1731
- The most sophisticated of the 18th Edition testers brings Type B RCD testing, 3-pole earth electrode testing to a downloading and rechargeable instrument.
Additional benefits are that is supplied in a large soft, carry case with sufficient space for the tester, test leads and some tools. The MFT1731 has enabled additional earth electrode testing options such as 3-pole ART electrode testing and stakeless electrode testing. The clamps are optional accessories.
