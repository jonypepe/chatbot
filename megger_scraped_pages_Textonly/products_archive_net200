Measures logical network performance
Evaluate capability of link connections and locate faults up to 500 meters
1000BASE-T, auto measurement of signal performance, wiremap and length
Large high resolution backlit display
1 kHz analogue tone signal output
Built in TDR and TDX
NET200 is an all-in-one and easy-to-use network testing unit measuring logical network performance and the physical condition of network cables. It is the tool of choice, allowing network engineers to install and efficiently maintain local area network (LAN) with 10BASE-T and/or 100BASE-TX based Ethernet protocol.
It provides round-trip time (RTT) testing to measure network speed under dynamic and static configuration protocols and IP scanning to show the information on all terminals connected with the local network. It can also evaluate the capability of link connections such as supported network speed (10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX) and duplexity (half- or full- duplex).
The device provides physical information for the LAN cable under tests such as cable length, faulty positions (open or short) and Wiremap (Pass/Fail).
With the novel high-resolution graphic TDR (Time-Domain Reflectometer) and TDX (Time-Domain Crosstalk), it is possible for the user to locate faulty positions along cables up to 500 meters in length.
The TDR and TDX can also be used with other types of cable, such as coaxial cables for cable TV and HFC networks and telephony cables.
The NET200 is supplied as a kit comprising a complete set of testing cables and adapters, and has one of the largest selection of functions available in its class. This makes the NET200 one of the best feature to value instruments on the market today.
