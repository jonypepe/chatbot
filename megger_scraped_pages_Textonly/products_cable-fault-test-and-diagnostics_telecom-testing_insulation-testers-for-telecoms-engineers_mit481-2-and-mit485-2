The MIT480/2 series of insulation and continuity testers replace the original MIT480 range and are designed specifically for the telecommunications and cable testing markets. The new units feature a redesigned case, back stand, and six-cell battery compartment with separate fuse access. All instruments are over-molded for increased protection and have an IP54 weatherproof rating.
The MIT480/2 series uses a three-terminal measurement design that permits the connection of all three test leads for A, B, and E (or Tip, Ring and Ground/Earth). The measurement pair can be selected from the A-B-E (T-R-G) button on the front panel and the selection is confirmed in the display. You don't need to disconnect the test leads to measure individual pairs.
Alternatively, the units can be used as a conventional two-terminal instrument.
The range consists of two instruments:
MIT481/2: 50 V, 100 V, 250 V, 500 V* + storage
MIT485/2: 50 V, 100 V, 250 V, 500 V* + storage + download + recharge ready
* Gated access – prevents accidental selection
