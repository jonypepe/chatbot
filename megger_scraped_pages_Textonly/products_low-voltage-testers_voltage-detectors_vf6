Overview
Technical
Hazardous area EX rated
AC non-contact voltage detector
12 V – 1000 V voltage range
Visual, audible, and vibration warning of low and medium voltages
Built-in bright white LED torch
The VF6 hazardous area AC voltage detector has designed to be used to check for the presence of AC voltage, indicated by a bright red LED situated within the white nylon tip, an audible sounder, and a vibration alert. The detector has both low voltage (12 - 1000 V) and medium voltage (100 - 1000 V) ranges.
The VF6 EX has the added advantage of a bright white LED torch for use in poor light and has been rated for use on gas platforms and other petrochemical environments. It is suitable for identifying live conductors, finding a break in a conductor, verifying a blown fuse while in circuit, and detecting AC voltage at socket outlets, switches, circuit breakers, fuses, cables, and luminaires.
