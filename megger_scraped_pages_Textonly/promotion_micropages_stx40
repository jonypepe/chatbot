Portable cable fault locating system
A new lightweight champion with a heavyweight's punch
Cable fault location systems have to meet steep requirements to be considered truly portable and thus outdoor-ready for use in the field. Units must be lightweight, rugged, inured to hostile and challenging environments, very mobile in adverse terrain and as compact in size as possible. Units must also be operable in rain as well as in very bright daylight conditions with intense sunshine. The
STX40
is the only fault locating unit in its class with such a degree of outdoor-readiness. No competitor comes even close.
