Data sheet -  VLF20 kV
Overview
Technical
This product has now been discontinued.
20 kV with 0.1 Hz Cosine Square Wave Voltage
In accordance with most regulations, cables and joints must be tested after installation or repair. For this test the breakdown strength of the cable is tested.
The portable VLF Test System 20 kV can be used to test the cables in conjunction with the according local regulations for operating voltage levels up to 11 kV for new cables and 16 kV for aged cables at 3 µF cable capacity.
By using the patented 0.1 Hz Cosine Square Wave Voltage PE, XLPE and paper cables are brought to a controlled breakdown very fast without causing additional damage or aging to the cable insulation.
