Case study: What is melting here? Time for an SFRA test
This case study has been generously supplied by the Hitachi Energy Service group in Sweden. A 22 MVA, 10.5 kV/276 V (voltage regulation from 336 to 216 V), Diii furnace transformer, operating in heavy use for many years at a steel melting plant in Europe was subjected to a complete series of tests after a sudden failure during operation. The service contractor evaluated the electrical and dielectric condition of this transformer. During service, this type of transformer has its secondary winding connected externally in a Delta configuration through a high current bridge.

Case study: Misleading line frequency insulation results on a contaminated transformer
A 1978 vintage, 20 MVA, 69/13.09 kV, Dyn1 transformer, operating for a major North American utility, was taken out of service to repair a pump in the cooling system. The technical maintenance team completed the required repairs and conducted a complete protocol of routine commissioning tests, including a 10 kV line frequency (LF) power factor (PF) test.

Case study: True dynamic resistance measurement
Pinpointing concealed problems inside a resistive-type OLTC before physical inspection - the application of true DRM.A maintenance team at the Electric Power Transmission Network in the City of Karbala performed routine electrical tests on a transformer including: winding resistance measurements (WRM), transformer turns ratio (TTR), short circuit impedance (SCI), excitation current, and line-frequency power factor (a.k.a. dissipation factor or tan delta). This case study looks into their investigations and their results.
