The Baker DX static motor analyser gives you confidence that a motor is correctly wound and insulated before it’s deployed in the field. In an industrial setting, the consequential cost of failure or unplanned downtime of critical rotating machinery can be significant. The Baker DX series can apply a wide set of off-line electrical tests to assess the condition of motors and coils.
The standards-compliant surge test – this has been a signature feature of Baker testers for decades – is the only test that can safely expose turn-to-turn insulation weaknesses. The Baker DX can find early indications of insulation weakness and faults in windings, between phases, coil-to-coil and in groundwall insulation. It can identify if contamination is impacting insulation strength. It can also detect problems with connections such as feed cable insulation weakness, motor imbalances, opens, or high resistance.
The DX’s benefits can be extended to low-impedance coils, such as armatures, through the use of the
Baker ZTX low impedance coil accessory
. The ZTX, which includes the ATF5000 commutator probe accessory, allows the DX to apply surge tests to coils which require higher currents.
Baker Surveyor DX Software
Surveyor DX software enables Baker DX operators to use a personal computer to store more test data, generate and view reports across the full spectrum of Baker DX tests, and share and compare analysis with other maintenance personnel using data from multiple analysers. Learn more from the
Baker Surveyor DX data sheet.
