Overview
Technical
Software
This product is now obsolete and has been replaced by the
TTRU3
Stand-alone or remote-control operation
Accurately measures ratio, phase deviation and excitation current
Field upgradeable without compromise to calibration
Built-in capability for storing and downloading test results in an XML format, via RS-232, Ethernet or USB ports (depending on model)
Works in the presence of high interference/high voltage
Highest ratio measurement (45,000:1); highest accuracy (0.1%)
Displays % error vs. name plate with pass/fail limits
The TTR300 Series of three-phase transformer turns ratio test sets are designed to measure the turns ratio of power, instrument, and distribution transformers in a substation or manufacturing environment. A rugged and robust design makes these instruments well suited for use in a variety of harsh environments. Our leads are specially designed to provide the necessary flexibility needed in cold weather.
The TTR300 Series are ideal for use by power transformer manufacturers. Their unique testing procedures and storage capability allows an operator to set up and test difficult three-phase transformers (with multiple tap changers and bushing CTs) in a fraction of the time than it used to take with other TTRs. This test also includes a pass/fail limit of individual ratios.
