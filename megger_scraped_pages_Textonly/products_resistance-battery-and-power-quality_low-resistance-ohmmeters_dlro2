Overview
Technical
Software
New Difference Meter for quick data comparisons
Use long leads at 1 A without compromising test speed
Safely test the resistance of inductive loads at 1 A
< 600 V active protection against inadvertent live connections without blowing a fuse
Ideal for outdoor use with protection against dust and moisture to IP54
Industry standard safety rated at CAT III 600 V/CAT IV 300 V
The DLRO2 2 A Low resistance ohmmeter is a handheld instrument designed to give you fast, accurate, repeatable measurements, even in electrically noisy locations. The DLRO2 is the latest in a long line of instruments to proudly display the Ducter™ brand, the Ducter™ testers being as well-known and relied upon as Megger insunsulation resistance testers.
The DLRO2 can measure low resistance values across a wide range of applications, including railways, aircraft, and industry components. This tough device comes with a brand new ‘difference’ meter that allows repetitive measurements to be easily compared with an initial reference measurement. The difference meter also translates the percentage difference to a needle/pointer movement, making the changes clear to see.
If your applications require long test leads, then the DLRO2 can provide this without compromising test speed or safety. It has a dedicated long lead test to optimise the output, and this long test lead function is able to provide up to 1 A of test current into 4 ohms resistance. The DLRO2, with its optional cable reel test leads, is therefore ideal for testing wind turbine and avionic lightning protection applications.

DLRO2 Firmware Update
The DLRO2 will automatically update when the instrument is turned on if a firmware update is available.
Installation instructions:
1. Extract the zip archive to the root folder of a USB pen drive.
2. Plug the USB pen drive in to the USB slot at the top of the instrument.
3. The boot loader screen will be displayed when the instrument starts up.
4. Press [OK] to upgrade the firmware or [TEST] to cancel.
5. The update will progress through various stages.
6. When complete, remove the USB.
7. Restart the DLRO (turn off and on).
8. The firmware update screen will display while the update is in progress.
9. The instrument will reboot after the update is complete.
