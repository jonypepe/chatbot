Overview
Technical
Measures contact resistance in circuit breakers, disconnecting switches, busbar connections, safety devices, etc.
Easy to operate
Designed for rugged field use
Highly flexible cable connections
Portable and lightweight, weighs only 14 kg (31 lbs)
The MOM200A is a 200 A micro-ohmmeter designed to check and measure contact resistances in high voltage circuit breakers, disconnecting switches (isolators), and busbar joints. The instrument is an excellent choice when 200 amperes or less are needed for a specitic measurement.
Since the MOM200A weighs only about 14 kg (31 lbs), it's easy to bring with you in difficult to reach locations. What's more, it's ideal for finding poor connections since it can put out 100 A for extended periods and its range extends up to 20 milliohms, making it ideal for testing a wide range of connections.
