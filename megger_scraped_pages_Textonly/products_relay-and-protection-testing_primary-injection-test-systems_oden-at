Overview
Technical
Software
Most advanced primary current injection test system to simplify all types of switchgear, CT commissioning, ground grid, circuit breaker testing, and more
Modular design to permit optimal user configuration of output current versus unit size
Compact transport cart makes it easier to move into switchgear rooms with limited space
Unique I/30 function allows the current to be pre-set using a low current to prevent test sample heating, thus eliminating corruption of test result
The ODEN AT primary current injection test system has been specially designed for testing protective relay equipment and circuit breakers. It can also be used to test the turns ratio of current transformers and for other applications that require high variable currents. The ODEN AT can also be set to test circuit breakers with reclosing relays and sectionalisers and is ideal for performing heat runs as the current can be applied continuously or through programmable intervals. It is also capable of testing the integrity of ground grids and safety-ground devices.
The system consists of a control unit with one, two, or three current units. There are three versions of the current unit: S, X, and H. The S and X current units are identical except that the X unit has an additional 30/60 V output. The H unit is rated for even higher current. These current units make it possible to configure the ODEN AT system for a range of different tests.
The control unit has many advanced features, such as a powerful measurement section that can display turns ratio as well as time, voltage, and current. A second measurement channel can also be used to test an additional current or voltage. The ODEN AT can calculate the current transformer turns ratio, impedance, resistance, power, power factor/tan delta, and phase angle.
The current and voltage can be presented as percentages of nominal value. It also has a fast-acting hold function that freezes short-duration readings on the digital display, so when the voltage or contact signal arrives at the 'stop' input, the object under test interrupts the current, or the injection is stopped.
All parts are portable, and the ODEN AT can be quickly assembled and connected.
