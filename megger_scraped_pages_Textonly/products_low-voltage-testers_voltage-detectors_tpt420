The Megger TPT420 voltage tester is designed to provide electricians and electrical engineers with an easy-to-use voltage indicating instrument. The meter will continue to warn the operator of dangerous test voltages even when the batteries are exhausted. With both LCD and LED displays, the TPT420 provides both AC and DC voltage measurement from 12 to 1000 V AC and up to 1500 V DC. In addition, a continuity function within the range 0 to 500 kΩ, is included and for added safety, continuity, and voltage measurements are also accompanied by an acoustic sounder.
When testing between phase and earth on any circuit protected by an RCD, RCBO, and Safety Breaker, the TPT420 is designed to work below the tripping threshold of these devices to help avoid unintentional disconnection. The phase rotation indication test has been simplified, which now avoids the crossing of the test probes. The TPT420 can also perform a single-pole voltage indication test.
The instrument has a bright, integrated LED torch to help you when working in poorly lit environments and, it is safety rated at CAT IV 1000 V with an IP64 housing, and conforms to the latest IEC/EN 61243-3 and DIN VDE 0682-401 standards. For compliance, GS38 probe tip shrouds are provided as standard, along with a protective storage and carry pouch.
Although designed for testing within electrical installations, the unit can be used in almost any application where voltage and continuity measurements are required, including automotive, fire alarm, and solar/PV systems.
