Megger director among the nation’s top 100 in manufacturing
Megger director among the nation’s top 100 in manufacturing
The manufacturing director at Dover-based Megger has been selected in the top 100 people who work in manufacturing in a national awards programme.
Ronny Titeca, Lean Manufacturing Director at Megger’s Dover manufacturing facility, was chosen by judges among hundreds of entries for the top 100 list run annually by
The Manufacturer
magazine, a leading business-to-business publication for this sector.
Ronny was selected in three categories: Driver of Cultural Change, Inspiring Leader and Unsung Hero. The Manufacturer Top 100 Awards were announced in December 2021, in the seventh year the programme has run.
“I am delighted to be nominated and then chosen for the Top 100,” said Ronny. “There are some very talented people and some strong brand names in this group; to be selected among them is an honour. I’m pleased that some of my work and innovations at Megger have been recognised externally, but I have a great team of people at Megger who deserve to share the credit.”
Ronny is responsible for making production more efficient at the company, which engineers and manufactures testing equipment and monitoring solutions for the electrical power industry. His nomination highlighted his work in establishing a clear career pathway in manufacturing involving a new skills matrix, introducing both technician apprenticeships and a performance bonus scheme.
He also created a successful initiative called the PCB Hub, to develop the Dover facility’s printed circuit board manufacturing capability so it can serve customers with new products.
Megger employs over 350 people in Dover and 1,300 people globally, has nine factories worldwide, with customer reach in over 160 countries. The company made two acquisitions and joined in a strategic partnership in the last two years, to develop monitoring solutions for utilities to measure electrical network performance.
The Top 100 judging panel is appointed from across industry and includes senior people from the Institution of Engineering and Technology, the High Value Manufacturing Catapult (a government funded agency) and Cranfield University.
