The GI
Smonitor
Portable partial discharge monitoring system is the portable version of the GIS
monitor
for temporary monitoring of partial discharge activity on gas insulated switchgear (GIS). To ensure reliable and precise results of the system under all harsh environmental or weather conditions, it is adviseable to use the protective housing the ICM
outlander.
The GIS
monitor
Portable is available in different housings:
Half 19 inch portable, lightweight desktop enclosure
19 inch portable, lightweight desktop enclosure
Shock resistant and watertight outdoor case
Black mini aluminum box
The GIS
monitor
partial discharge monitoring system is a specialised and fully automated monitoring system for gas insulated switchgears (GIS) for partial discharge (PD) activity. No PD activity is left undetected due to parallel PD measurement on over 100 channels. All data is collected, stored, and automatically analysed in one central server.
The unit detects and digitises any ultra high frequency signal within microseconds. It calculates a separation of PD events from external disturbance or internal switching pulses in real-time and provides an effective PD and alarm detection.
The common software interface provides easy access to view, compare, and analyse the entire GIS in depth. PD activity can be easily monitored on the entire GIS system without interrupting its operation. Partial discharge signals are taken from embedded or external UHF sensors providing a signal bandwidth of up to 1.8 GHz. External noise and switching pulses can be separated from internal PD. The system connects to the substation monitoring systems via IEC61850 or I/O signal interfaces.
