ICM
system
Generation 5
The ICMsystem is Power Diagnostix high end partial discharge (PD) measurement device, continuously improved and updated since it was introduced early 1993. It offers real time parallel PD recording with AC and DC setups, RIV measurement according to NEMA and CISPR standards, cable fault location (TDR), acoustic PD location, PD pattern analysis, spectrum analysis, a wide range of applicable accessories, and a powerful software tool for advanced analysis and reporting. The field of applications ranges from research on insulation materials, quality control tests, predictive condition based maintenance, up to advanced on-site fault analysis.

ICM
flex
The ICMflex combines partial discharge, loss factor (tan delta) measurement, and PD cable fault location in one unique system. All signals are taken directly on HV potential, transferred via Bluetooth or fiber optic cable to a remote computer. The portable ICMflex system is available from 30kVrms up to 150kVrms for on-site testing, or it can be customized for lab applications even for higher voltage levels. Test frequencies are adjustable from VLF (0.02Hz - 0.5Hz) up to 300Hz. Typical applications are medium voltage class cable testing, or diagnostic insulation tests on rotating machines.

GIS
monitor
The GISmonitor is a fully automated continuous online partial discharge (PD) monitoring system for gas insulated switchgear. The scalable architecture allows full parallel partial discharge pattern recording and fault detection on an unlimited number of channels. Partial discharge signals are taken from embedded or external UHF sensors providing a signal bandwidth of up to 1.8GHz. External noise and switching pulses can be separated from internal PD. The system connects to substation monitoring systems via IEC61850 or I/O signal interfaces.
