Increased insights and visibility of issues
Today's grids have numerous stresses from increasingly complex distribution systems and various energy sources. Having a limited insight into your grid's performance can lead to longer increased outages.
Our grid analytics help you detect and locate faults faster, allow constant analysis of your data, and help with discovering atypical events and weak spots, which reduces SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index).
Our Grid Analytics Solutions provide:
Fault detection and location
Real-time tracking of energy consumption
Predictive maintenance by identifying weak spots
Support for analysing your data
X
Improved reliability and efficiency
Grid Analytics Solutions help decrease the number of outages that occur due to missing prediction data and a lack of resources by providing data-driven insights that allow you to target your resources on the areas that are most likely to fail.
Our Grid Analytics Solutions provide:
Reduce duration and frequency of outages to improve SAIDI and SAIFI
Real-time data tracking
Predictive maintenance by identifying weak spots

Supporting the transition to renewables
The exchange of power, with contributions from distributed resources and more complicated consumption tied to renewable resources is adding complexity to power grids.
Renewable resources add harmonics to the grid which causes stress on electrical assets. Power flow is now multi-directional and less stable, and the growing use of electrical vehicles and DC charging stations contribute to additional stresses on power grids.
To manage these increasing risks real-time grid analytics tracking is essential to get a better understanding of the grid’s performance and to ensure an efficient and smooth transition into renewables as they become an even more important part in our industry.
Informed data-based decision making
Timely data and insightful analysis make key decisions regarding your grid simpler and more effective, thereby extending the life of your assets. Confidently locating weak spots and problem zones is a key benefit of Grid Analytics Solutions, and giving you the ability to prioritise maintenance and determine required repairs.
Factors that contribute to network management decisions:
Analysis of asset condition and load
Feasibility of additional loading for existing assets
Routing of power flow
X
Protecting your data with highest security standards
Due to rapid changes in the grid, AI, big data, and digital transformations are inevitable in the utility industry. These changes come, not only with increased benefits, but also with additional threats like, such as from cyber-attacks.
To overcome these challenges, our team has developed the highest level of protection for your data, and continuously improves our protections to stay one step ahead of security risks and threats.

Wildfire risk reduction
In warmer and dryer regions, wildfires are a threat to populations and infrastructure. Wildfires can be caused by several factors, one of them being electrical faults caused by broken conductors or vegetation encroachment. This leads to liability and financial consequences for power utilities.
High impedance transient faults frequently go unnoticed and are often caused by tree branches contacting power lines. These faults can indicate larger future problems, and can pose wildfire risks for power utilities. These risks can be reduced with the implementation of a monitoring and grid analytics system, such as Megger’s Grid Analytics Solutions.
The following methods can support power utilities in their efforts to reduce wildfire risks:
Detection of high impedance faults with low current thresholds
Detection of intermittent / transient faults
Analysis of monitoring data to identify weak spots in the grid
Vegetation management
