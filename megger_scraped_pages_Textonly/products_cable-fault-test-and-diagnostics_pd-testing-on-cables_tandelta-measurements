ICMflex
The ICMflex instrument family, introduced in 2008, bases on the latest concept where the entire acquisition hardware is placed on high voltage potential. The instruments are fully remote controlled via high speed Bluetooth or fiber optic communication.
TDAcompact
The TDAcompact is a loss factor meter. The capacitance Cx, the tanδ, and the voltage are derived by digitally processing the currents of the test capacitor and a reference capacitor.
