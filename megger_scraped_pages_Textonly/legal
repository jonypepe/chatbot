General Statements for the Megger UK Website
WEEE
The European Directive 2002/96/EC (as amended) on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) came into force in February 2003. The purpose of this directive is minimise the environmental impact of WEEE and to encourage its separate collection, subsequent treatment, reuse, recovery, recycling and environmentally sound disposal.
Electrical and electronic equipment should never be disposed with general waste collections but must be separately collected for their proper treatment and recovery. The crossed out wheeled bin placed on Megger products is a reminder to dispose of the product correctly at the end of its life.
Users of Megger products within the UK may dispose of them at the end of their useful life by contacting B2B Compliance at www.b2bcompliance.org.uk or by telephone on 01691 676124.
Megger is registered in the UK as a Producer of Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The Registration No is WEE/HE0146QT

RoHS
The European Directive 2002/95/EC (as amended) on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) came into force in February 2003. The purpose of this directive is to restrict the use of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, thereby contributing to the protection of human health and the environment.
The products produced by Megger are classified as Category 9, Monitoring and Control Products, and as such are not included within the scope of the RoHS Directive. Nevertheless, Megger is continually striving to exclude the restricted substances from its products whilst not compromising safety and reliability.

It seeks to improve the environmental performance of batteries and accumulators and of the activities of all economic operators involved in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators, e.g. producers, distributors and end-users and, in particular, those operators directly involved in the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators.
