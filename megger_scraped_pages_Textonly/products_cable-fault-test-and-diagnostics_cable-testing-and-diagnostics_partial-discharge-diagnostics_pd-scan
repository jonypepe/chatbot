The PD Scan is an on-line partial discharge (PD) handheld scanner for detecting defects in medium and high voltage systems (MV and HV). Such defects not only require costly repairs, but also can lead to failures of entire network sections with corresponding consequences. Therefore, it is in the interest of all network operators to recognise signs of impending defects as early as possible and to be able to take appropriate countermeasures on time.
With the PD Scan, Megger offers a lightweight, robust, and portable PD scanner that can quickly inspect various type of equipment for partial discharge signals.
The PD Scan is used for the early detection of partial discharges emanating from defects in medium voltage switchgears and other electric equipment. For this purpose, the device has two internal sensors (TEV and airborne acoustic) and can also be operated with various types of external sensors (TEV, HFCT, airborne acoustic, and contact probes). Thanks to the large variety of sensors, the PD Scan can be used for multiple application ranges. For instance, PD within the cable insulation can be detected using the HFCT sensor, PD in encapsulated switchgears can be measured by using the contact-probe sensor, and corona and surface discharges in MV and HV systems can be identified with the parabolic acoustic sensor
The operation of the device is simple; it can be controlled via the three soft keys as well as via the intuitive touch screen display. Thanks to the auto-recognition of the connected external sensor, malfunction operation, as well as bothersome browsing through individual screens, can be eliminated.
