Overview
Technical
Noise rejection mode with Confidence Meter™
Manual and auto save results for export to USB
Difference Meter for quick data comparisons
Use long test leads at 1 A using dedicated test mode
Safely test the resistance of inductive loads at 1 A
<600 V active protection against inadvertent live connections without blowing a fuse 
Ideal for outdoor use with protection against dust and moisture to IP54 
Industry standard safety rated at CAT III 600 V/CAT IV 300
The DLRO2X 2 A Low resistance ohmmeter is a handheld instrument designed to give you fast, accurate, repeatable measurements, even in electrically noisy locations. The DLRO2X is the latest in a long line of instruments to proudly display the Ducter™ brand, the Ducter™ testers being as well-known and relied upon as Megger insulation resistance testers.
The DLRO2X can measure low resistance values across a wide range of applications, including railways, aircraft, and industry components. This tough device comes with a brand new ‘Difference Meter' that allows repetitive measurements to be easily compared with an initial reference measurement. The difference meter also translates the percentage difference to a needle/pointer movement, making the changes clear to see.
If you work in utilities or industry, the DLRO2X provides you with a high level of safety with a CAT III 600 V/CAT IV 300 V rating to IEC61010. In addition, the instrument can protect itself from inadvertent connections to up to 600 V without blowing a fuse, thereby avoiding essential time lost due to repairs or finding a replacement fuse.
If your applications require long test leads, then the DLRO2X can provide this without compromising test speed or safety. It has a dedicated long lead test to optimise the output, and this long test lead function is able to provide up to 1 A of test current into 4 ohms resistance. The DLRO2X, with its optional cable reel test leads, is therefore ideal for testing wind turbine and avionic lightning protection applications.
If the high noise indicator appears on the display while using either the normal mode, long test lead mode, or the inductive mode, then the measurement is being affected by noise and the results may not be reliable. To assist with this situation, the DLRO2X is equipped with a noise rejection test mode. In this test mode, the current is passed continuously and in one direction only. The instrument then feeds a stream of measurements into our patented Confidence Meter™. The measurement is then refined until a stable, accurate measurement is obtained.
The DLRO2X can also save results to its internal memory. Folders can be created to store results for each asset ID and when the test is complete, the results can be manually saved to a chosen asset ID or the Auto Save function can be set up so that all results will automatically be saved to a specified folder once the test has completed. These results can then be copied to a USB drive to transfer to your PC.
