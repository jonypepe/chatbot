Overview
Technical
Designed for electrical and industrial testing
Insulation testing up to 1000 V and 200 GΩ range
Stabilised insulation test voltage
Single range, faster continuity testing from 0.01 Ω to 1 MΩ
Insulation test voltage from 10 V to 1000 V
600 V TRMS AC and DC voltage measurement
Live circuit detection and protection
CAT IV 600 V and IP54
The MIT415/2 and MIT417/2 CAT IV insulation testers are not only designed for electrical and industrial use, but also for an exceptionally wide range of applications including electrical installations, cable testing, motor testing, automotive, ESD, panel building, avionics, maintenance, and more.
The instruments have enhanced insulation testing with feedback-controlled test voltages to limit overvoltage to 2 %, rather than the industry standard of 10 % to 20 %. The output voltage is maintained between 0 and 2 % throughout the test range. Additionally, continuity testing is now significantly faster, and a single autoranging 0.01 Ω to 1.0 MΩ function replaces the “ohms” and “kOhms” ranges. Retained are the 200 mA and 20 mA test options.
Replacing the original MIT400 instruments, these new units feature a redesigned case, back-stand, and a six-cell battery compartment with separate fuse access. All instruments are over-moulded for increased protection and achieve an IP54 weatherproof rating.
The MIT415/2 and MIT417/2 include additional low voltage insulation test voltages at 10 V and 25 V for ESD and low voltage signal-wire testing, as found in lifts/elevators. The MIT415/2 also incluses a display option to show 105, 106, and 107, instead of the usual KΩ, MΩ, and GΩ etc.
