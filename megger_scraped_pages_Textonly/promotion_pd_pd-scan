Online PD handheld scanner
Defects in medium and high voltage systems not only require costly repairs, but can lead to failures of entire network sections with corresponding consequences. Therefore, it is in the interest of all network operators to recognize signs of impending defects as early as possible and to be able to take appropriate countermeasures on time.
With the PD Scan, Megger offers a lightweight, robust and portable PD scanner that can quickly inspect various type of equipment for partial discharge signals.
Universal application range thanks to a variety of sensors
Applications
MV-switchgear
The primary task of the PD scan is to survey MV switchgear and check for potential problems such as defects in terminations, current and voltage transformers, bushings or bus bars. As each type of switchgear differs it needs different type of sensors to couple out the partial discharge signals. For enclosed switchgear it is recommend to use a combination of TEV and acoustic contact sensors, whereas for air insulated switchgear a flexible acoustic sensor is recommended.
Bus bars
Bus bars are critical components within the substation, if these fail it can cause massive damage, high costs and long outage times. Using the parabolic receiver these bus bars can be surveyed for partial discharge activity. If these bus bars are encapsulated then other sensors such as TEV and acoustic contact probe are recommended.
Bushings
Bushings within MV substations can be within the switchgear or in larger plants also be in walls or ceilings. Especially the latter is common for older type of plants. These bushings are often used with bus bars, so same criticality applies. A breakdown of one of the bushing can cause therefore massive damage and long outage times. Wall and ceiling bushings can be analysed using the parabolic acoustic receiver, bushings within enclosed switchgear via TEV and acoustic contact probe sensor.
MV cables
Using the HFCT sensor partial discharges in medium-voltage cables can be detected, making the PD scan the ideal pre-screening tool for offline PD measurements. Resources can be allocated on those cables which have the highest priority for offline PD measurements only. For commissioning tests on new cable circuits still an offline PD diagnosis is recommended as higher test voltages than operating voltage is needed to check the quality of workmanship.
Transformers
Also distribution transformers can be analysed with the PD scan. Applying the flexible acoustic receiver or parabolic acoustic receiver, terminations and bushings can be scanned for PD activity and countermeasures can be taken if PD activity exists.
Outdoor HV components
The parabolic receiver is also ideal for outdoor applications to scan HV components such as terminations, surge arresters, transformer bushings and isolators for corona and surface discharges. Corona discharges are common and not that dangerous, surface discharges however can cause premature failures. Therefore it is of utmost importance to properly scan these components using the directionality of the receiver and its integrated laser pointer.
Features
Temperature and humidity sensor
As temperature and humidity can have a significant influence on the partial discharge activity it is of utmost importance to properly document this. The PD Scan comes with a temperature and humidity sensor, data is therefore directly stored with the measurement data itself allowing proper assessment.
Intuitive operation
Users will be surprised about the simplicity of operation using either soft keys or the touchscreen. Especially the implemented features within the touchscreen saves users from bothersome browsing.
Say goodbye to maloperation
One of the goals of the development of this
    handy device was to minimize the number of connections. All in all, there are only two interfaces on the device. This was made possible thanks to the smart auto-recognition of the connected sensors; faulty measurements due to operator error are a thing of the past.
Wireless headphone
As of the integrated Bluetooth functionality it is possible to connect wireless headphones. Twisting of cables is therefore a thing of the past.
Pictures speak louder than words
PD detected; then using the integrated camera this can directly be documented. All data is securely stored in one location and images can be easily included in the final report.
QR code scanner
This functionality saves on-the-spot tedious renaming of folders as switchgear data can be taken over directly. In addition it is possible to see the data of the last measurement.
The PD Scan is available in 4 different application-based sets:
Switchgear basic
The PD Scan Basic Set includes the main unit which has two internal sensors (TEV, acoustic). In addition, it includes an external TEV sensor for localizing partial discharges and a temperature and humidity sensor.
Switchgear basic + cable
This kit also includes a HFCT sensor for online PD measurements on the cable.
Switchgear pro + cable
In addition to Set 2, this set includes an acoustic contact probe sensor, which is ideal for online PD measurements on enclosed switchgear, and a flexible acoustic sensor for simple indoor acoustic measurements along seem, gaps and small openings.
Switchgear pro + cable + outdoor
In addition to set 3, a parabolic acoustic receiver with laser pointer is included, which is ideal for outdoor use such as surveying of HV components for surface and corona discharges.
