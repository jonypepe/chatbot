The RCDT300 series of residual current device testers are innovative instruments that combine rugged construction with intuitive operation. Even if they are inadvertently connected to a live three-phase supply, Megger’s RCDT300 range remain undamaged and present no safety hazard to you.
Available in three models, the RCDT300 series are compact and easy to use. Their rubber overmoulding gives them additional protection, plus they come with a built-in display cover. All models in the range are water and dust resistant with an IP54 rating.
There are three models in the range:
RCDT310
: suitable for use on supplies between 100 V and 280 V, and offers 0.5I, I and 5I tests, with provision for tests starting at 0 ° or 180 ° of the supply waveform, as well as for DC tests. It also has facilities for testing standard and selective RCDs and covers current ranges from 30 mA to 500 mA. When connected to a live supply, it defaults to voltmeter mode.
RCDT320:
covers a wider supply voltage range of 50 V to 280 V, allowing use with centre-tapped 110 V supplies. It incorporates ramp testing, for RCD tripping current measurement, and the unique Megger auto sequence test feature, which saves time by allowing the tester to conduct all RCD tests and store the results while the operator stands by the RCD, resetting it as appropriate.
RCDT330:
has an extended operating current range to cover 10 mA to 1000 mA devices, and the ability to measure AC supply voltage and frequency is added. The large LCD screen displays test results and is backlit in this model, making it easier to use in locations with low ambient light levels.
The RCDT330 additionally offers the facility to save test results to internal memory. Over 1000 result can be saved on site and downloaded to a computer when convenient. Data is stored in non-volatile memory, being retained when the instrument is switched off or batteries are exhausted.
