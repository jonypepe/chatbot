Overview
Technical
200 A AC open-jaw current measurement
0.1 V to 1000 V auto-ranging AC and DC voltage measurement
0.1 Ω to 20.00 MΩ resistance range
Continuity buzzer
Diode check
Non-contact detection of AC voltage
CAT III 1000V and CAT IV 600 V
The Megger DCM330 fork multimeter is a convenient, compact instrument designed to measure AC current up to 200 A, as well as perform all the functions of a basic multimeter.
The DCM330 is a versatile instrument, capable of performing AC and DC voltage measurements up to 1000 V and resistance measurements up to 20 MΩ. It also has a non-contact voltage detection facility and a continuity buzzer with diode check - and all of this is functionality has been put into a single compact instrument, eliminating the need for separate multimeter and clamp meter.
This instrument can be operated easily with one hand and can be used ambidextrously, thanks to its large central control knob, and its separate voltage/resistance test leads can be disconnected when not in use.
The open-jaw design of the fork multimeter enables simple and fast measurements to be made on single conductors up to 16 mm diameter. With no moving clamp parts, the Megger DCM330 is not susceptible to dirt, grit, or moisture around the cable, so it's equally suited for use in dirty trenches as well as clean laboratory conditions.
The DCM330 also provides average responding RMS values, and with the conductor(s) positioned centrally and squarely within the jaws, achieves readings of over 3 % accuracy.
