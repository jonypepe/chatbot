The TC3231 thermal camera offers a professional infrared 32 x 31 pixels image thermometer with a 2.2 inch (55.88 mm) colour TFT LCD display. The camera gives you quick and accurate readings covering a wide range of surface temperature measurements. It combines the convenience of an infrared thermometer with the visual advantage of a thermal imager, providing you with a troubleshooting camera with an infrared heat map.
The TC3231 features a range of selectable thermal image colour palette display options, along with high/low user pre-set temperature alarms. For convenience, the background temperature is also selectable.
The camera also has an easy-to-use image blending function; the camera takes an aligned visible, non-infrared, image, together with a full infrared image. The two pictures are then blended and can be adjusted between 0 to 100 %. This makes identifying problems and pinpointing their location far easier. As well as centre spot temperature measurement, the camera also offers simultaneous hot and cold spot tracking, with resultant values and location updated continuously on the display.
Up to 6000 images can be saved on the included micro SD memory card, which can be downloaded to a PC via the USB drive in BMP file format. An SD card adapter is also provided for file transfer directly to a computer if required.
