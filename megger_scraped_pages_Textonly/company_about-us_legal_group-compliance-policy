Group compliance policy
Group compliance policy
Purpose
Megger Group will operate within a sustainable framework for the benefit of all stakeholders. lt is committed to integrity and high Standards of business in everything it does. Megger will do business only by lawful and ethical means.
Scope
Applies to all employees within the Megger Group and their relationships with all customers, suppliers, employees, governments and other stakeholders.
Policy
lt is always unacceptable to promise, offer or accept bribes or other improper payments and favours, and Megger does not, and will not, participate in corrupt, abusive or illegal practices either at home or overseas and will not request or condone others doing so.
Megger Group will always operate within the legal and moral framework of the countries within which it is located and within which it trades.
Consequently, Megger expects that all employees will maintain the highest professional standards in their dealings with third parties and with other Megger employees and will ensure adherence to legal requirements, rules, procedures and proper practices.
Individual Megger sites will have their own written policies/procedures in place to implement this overall Group policy at their site in accordance with local requirements/best practice. These documents will be included in the induction programmes of all new employees with commercial and managerial responsibilities.
1. Selling
1.1
With the exception of the payment of duly documented and authorised invoices for goods and services actually received in the normal course of business and recorded in the books of the company, Megger or Megger employees will never give cash (or its equivalent) to suppliers or their representatives, customers or their representatives, or other third parties
1.2
With the exception of
minor Group branded promotional items
other minor items of nominal value
food/refreshments that are incidental to a business meeting
Megger or its employees will not give any gifts or provide other inducements to customers, their employees, employees' families, or any third parties. This policy will not preclude Megger making a contribution towards the travel expenses of distributors and customers visiting legitimate Megger conferences, training sessions etc, nor does it prohibit reasonable hospitality expenditure that enables meetings with customers and distributors in an informal environment (hospitality will not be provided in circumstances where Megger staff will not be in attendance).
1.3
Megger will only pay commissions to duly appointed representatives/agents with whom Megger has a pre-existing written contract that fully describes the services to be performed and all consideration to be paid. Any such payments should not be in excess of the customary local rate for such services, but in exceptional circumstances where payments above that customary rate are agreed they must be authorised in writing by the VP responsible for the profit centre accepting the related order and a justification for the payment Ievel held on file.
1.4
Megger will not knowingly accept or fulfil orders from customers where the supply of the goods requested would be in breach of any trade embargos (or other statutory requirements and restrictions) of the country in which the products were manufactured, the country from which the products are sold, or the country to which the products are sold.
1.5
Megger employees will not distort any financial Statements, documents or other records (whether paper, electronic or other format) and will always provide consistent and accurate paperwork to all parties concerned
in any transaction.
1.6
Megger products will always be designed to conform to the local safety regulations, standards and legal requirements of the countries within which they are sold and any product labelling (e.g. safety standards, quality standards, country of origin, etc.) will be accurate.

This policy will not preclude Megger employees from accepting a contribution towards their travel expenses when visiting legitimate conferences, training sessions etc, nor does it prohibit them from accepting reasonable hospitality that enables meetings with customers, suppliers etc in an informal environment. ln all circumstances however employees should obtain approval from their manager before accepting such items.
2.3

2.5
