Technical
Type-B RCD and three-phase RCD testing for industrial applications with no earth/ground
Two-wire and three-wire non-trip loop testing for RCD protected circuits
Choice of 3-pole, 3-pole with attached rod technique, 2-pole and stakeless tests for earth electrode resistance measurement
Simple colour-coded test selection and large clear backlit display for ease of use
Auto reversing continuity test of a choice of 200 mA and 15 mA test currents
Internal memory and Bluetooth communications
EN61010 CATIV safety ratings and tough IP54 case
The MFT1800 series of multifunction installation testers have been designed for testing low voltage electrical installations to the requirements of all IEC 60364 derived standards. They provide all the tests required to complete the necessary electrical certification for industrial, commercial, and domestic fixed wiring installations.
The series is comprised of 3 instruments:
MFT1815
- The entry level tester offering CAT IV safety, 200 mA continuity, two-wire non trip loop testing with resistance and fault current display, frequency measurement and the largest, brightest, and clearest display on the market.
MFT1825
- The most popular of the range of testers offering all the benefits of the MFT1815, plus three-pole and two-pole earth electrode testing, 15 mA continuity testing, auto RCD testing, phase rotation, programmable and three-phase RCD testing, and current measurement with the optional clamp.
MFT1835
- This advanced model also includes Type B RCD testing, three-pole earth electrode testing with attached rod technique, and stakeless testing to a downloading and rechargeable instrument. It also features internally rechargeable batteries and charger with a charge time of less than 4 hrs.
All instruments are IEC 61010 CAT IV 300 V rated for connection to low voltage systems with no protective device, so can be safly connected anywhere on the system up to the source transformer without risk of damage from large transient spikes.
Visible and audible safety warnings are paramount when testing high energy systems, and the MFT1800 range includes full input protection and safety warnings when a hazardous voltage is present. If live voltages exist on a circuit during insulation or continuity testing, the voltage is displayed on the screen. If this voltage exceeds a safe level, further testing is inhibited and a warning sounds.
Quick to pick up and use, the rotary controls are colour-coded to make range selection easy and fast, also reducing the chance of using the wrong function or range. Additionally, the large clear backlit display uses the patented Megger digital/analogue arc, providing you with indication of fluctuating readings while the dual digital readout shows precise values of key measurements simultaneously with the test parameters, such as the output voltage on insulation testing as well as the resistance value in MΩ.
