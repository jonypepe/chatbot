Overview
Software
Generates graphs of demand and voltage/current data
Zooms-in on specific areas of interest
Produces detailed reports
Performs harmonic analysis
Extremely easy to use
Same look and feel for ease of use from one instrument to another
Metrosoft power quality analyser software is an easy-to-use software for harmonic analysis.
Metrosoft can provide the following:
Charts
of actual waveforms analysed
Bar chart
of harmonic magnitude for the selected waveform cycle
Harmonic analysis report
for the selected waveform cycle
Metrosoft has a quick recorder setup, enabling you to set up the power analysers for different test conditions in a matter of seconds. By simply filling in a form, you choose which phases to record, the corresponding out-of-limit values, which statistics to save (minimum, RMS, and/or maximum), etc. For added convenience, the software automatically computes the maximum recording time for you based on the selections you've made. Once the power analyser is set up for a test, it wiII retain this information until you change it. Also, the setup files may be saved on a disk for re-use.
Metrosoft provides complete reports of the recorded data, which can be viewed, printed, or exported to popular spreadsheet programs.
Summary and setup
report lists instrument setup information and summary of all recorded data
Tabular report: Power
includes all power data recorded for each input
Tabular report: Voltage and current
includes all voltage and current data recorded for each input
Total harmonic distortion (THD) summary report
includes the THD for each input as a percent of the fundamental for the first cycle of each event
Out-of-limits report
includes information on all out-of-limits events plus the status of all other inputs during each event
Metrosoft also provides detailed charts, allowing you to view multiple phases/parameters on a single chart, so problems are identified quickly. An exceptional graphing feature is the ability to zoom-in and enlarge specifc time periods for a closer look at unusual events. A scan line feature lets you move a line across the chart as the software displays the values for the date and time on the chart. This gives you exact numbers and eliminates the need to approximate. In addition, you can view the vector relationships for any demand interval. All charts can be printed on any printer supported by Windows.
