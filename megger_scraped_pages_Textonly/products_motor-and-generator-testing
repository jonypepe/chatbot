Electric motor test and monitoring solutions
Looking for Baker Instrument Company? We are now part of Megger!
Baker Instruments’ electric motor analysers fall into three categories:
Static analysers are used on off-line motors and generators to test motor circuit and insulation condition.
Dynamic analysers are used for monitoring on-line motors to capture power quality, motor condition and load issues.
Electric motor QC systems are designed for motor, generator and coil manufacturers to test the insulation and other parameters of coils, stators and armatures rapidly and repeatably in a production context.
