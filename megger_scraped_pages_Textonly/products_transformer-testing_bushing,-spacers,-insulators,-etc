Bushings, Spacers, Insulators, etc.
Overview
Partial discharge measurements on different kinds of high voltage components like bushings, spacers, insulators, etc. helps to protect the entire high voltage system.

PD Tests on Bushings, Spacers, Insulators, etc.
Quality control in terms of pretesting of accessories of
high voltage transformers
,
switchgear
or other key components becomes more and more an important issue to spread the responsibility on sub suppliers and their quality management system. Therefor, such manufacturing sites build up their own PD test bench for the final acceptance tests on bushings, spacers, insulators, etc. Providing test reports to customers showing the guarantee level of internal PD and the applied standards is common practice.
Power Diagnostix helps to design and to specify complete test benches. We cooperate with multiple partners in test room design and shop floor automation. The modularity of our equipment allows a customized design according to the needs of our customers.
PD tests on small bushings
Special PD Tests
Depending on the dimensions of the test objects such PD measurements can be done in a shielded room, shielded cage or within a small
test cabinet
, for instance. Testing solid insulation materials requires a minimum background noise level of 1
â€“
2pC.
