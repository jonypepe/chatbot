The LTW425 is a two-wire non-tripping high resolution loop tester for verifying the loop impedance of a live electrical circuit, i.e., without the need to disconnect the electrical supply. The instrument has a two-wire loop testing solution that does not trip 30 mA RCDs and can be used on a wide range of voltages.
The LTW425 offers a high current high resolution loop test to three decimal places. This is ideal for establishing the correct Ze on an incoming supply, especially on PME installations. Results of this test can also be used to calculate higher PFC results. To that end, the LTW425 can calculate up to 40 kA using the 0.001 Ω high current, resolution test range. The calculation uses the measured loop impedance and the measured line voltage to calculate the appropriate PFC.
