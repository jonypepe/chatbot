Weatherproof to IP54
Intelligent safety system for protection
The MIT300 series of insulation and continuity testers have been developed to meet the needs of today’s electrical contractors. They are not only durable and easy to use, but also incorporate a comprehensive set of features designed to ensure operator safety, even under conditions of accidental misuse.
The MIT310, MIT320, and MIT330 testers use both digital and analogue displays that simultaneously show the test results numerically, and in the form of a moving-arc bar graph that accurately simulates the operation of an analogue meter.
All products in the MIT300 range offer automatic discharge of the circuit after testing, audible and visual warning if the test probes are applied to a live circuit, and a test inhibit feature which operates automatically under live circuit conditions. The units also conform fully to IEC 61010-1 for use in Category III 600 V applications, and provide all of the facilities needed to meet insulation testing requirements relating to the current edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations.
All instruments in the the MIT300 range provide indication of insulation resistance up to 999 MΩ, 200 mA continuity testing, a fast-reacting continuity buzzer, and facilities for nulling the resistance of the test leads. The entry-level MIT300 offers insulation test voltages of 250 V and 500 V, while the remaining models allow testing at 250 V, 500 V, and 1000 V.
In line with other products in Megger's comprehensive new contractor range, MIT300 insulation testers feature rugged construction, with an impact-resistant rubber-overmoulded case, and innovative circuitry which guarantees high accuracy combined with stability of calibration. All testers come complete with a full calibration certificate.
In addition to the basic features, the mid-range MIT310 adds a default voltmeter function, while the MIT320 supplements these facilities with an a backlit display, illuminated range panel, insulation limit alarm, resistance measurement, and an adjustable threshold for the continuity buzzer. The MIT320 is also supplied with a switched test probe to speed hands free testing. An illuminated switched test probe is also available as an optional extra for the MIT320.
