Overview
Technical
Software
The MTDR300 has been discontinued and is being replaced by the Teleflex SX-1
3-phase TDR
Battery and mains operation
Range over 55 km (TDR)
Auto-ranging “Find end of Cable”
Auto-fault find “Cursor to Fault”
Single jog-dial operation via user-friendly menus
Large 10.4 inch full XGA colour display
Rugged, robust field-proven case
The MTDR300 is a three-phase time domain reflectometer (TDR) designed to provide you with quick, effective, accurate, and safe pre-location of cable faults in electrical networks.
The instrument is operated using a single jog dial and an intuitive menu system on a colour display. This is thanks to its CAS-1 software. This standalone software package is supplied with all MTDR300 units and allows you to download (and upload) saved traces for future analysis. It is also an ideal training package as it contains all features of the MTDR itself.
The MTDR300 can be combined with an impulse generator (thumper) and arc reflection filter so you can use a wider range of high voltage fault pre-location methods.
The MTDR300 can be powered from its internal rechargeable battery or mains power, enabling you to use it wherever you work, and its rugged, robust, field-proven case makes it suitable for use in challenging environments.
