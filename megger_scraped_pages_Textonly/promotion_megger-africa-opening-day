Megger Africa opens for business
Megger Africa opens for business
Megger, has set up a new sales and support office in Durban, South Africa.
This important and exciting development is the latest demonstration of
Megger’s commitment to serving the African market
effectively and efficiently, and to providing readily accessible technical support for its fast-growing customer base in the region. The office will serve customers throughout the African continent.
“The pace of electrification in Africa is increasing, with many major projects in progress and planned for the near future,”
said Daniel Salathé, Megger’s Sales Director for Africa, Middle East and India.
“We know that those working on these projects need fast,
local access to the latest test technology, backed by expert technical advice and support
. And that’s exactly what our new office will allow us to provide. But its services are not limited to large projects – all of our customers and partners in the region will benefit from even better and more responsive support than they have enjoyed in the past.”
Megger’s new office will initially have a permanent staff of two: Alan Goodson, Territory Sales Manager for South Africa and East Africa, and Nathaniel Folscher, an application engineer with wide experience of test techniques for power applications. A second application engineer will be joining the team in the near future. In addition to providing technical support, the office will handle all administration and project management for the region and will carry stocks of demonstration equipment.
