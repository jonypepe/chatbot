Overview
Technical
Software
Insulation testing up to 2.5 kV  and 200 GΩ range in a handheld instrument
Guard terminal for high resistance accuracy
Adjustable insulation test voltage from 50 V to 2500 V
Stabilised insulation test voltage
Rechargeable options for mains and car charging
Single range, faster continuity testing from 0.01 Ω to 1 MΩ
Polarisation Index (PI) and Dielectric Absorption Ratio (DAR)
CAT IV 600 V applications
The MIT2500 high voltage handheld insulation and continuity tester has been designed for motor and cable testing, specialist applications, and electrical testing  applications, where operation voltages exceed 1000 V and higher insulation test voltages are needed.
The MIT2500 offers both fixed range voltages of 50 V, 100V, 250 V, 500 V, 1000 V, and 2500 V, as well as a variable range that allows any voltage between 50 V and 2500 V to be 'dialled in'. This is supported by the new test voltage feedback control, which maintains the output test voltage to within 2 % of the selected range, even when under test. The feedback-controlled insulation test voltage is now accurate to +2 % -0 % compared to the original +20 %, providing a more accurate test voltage without the risk of overvoltage damage to circuits. A variable range allows the exact test voltage to be selected from 50 V to 999 V in 1 V steps, (1 kV to 2.5 kV in 10 V steps) providing 1100 test voltage options.
The MIT2500 uses a redesigned case, back-stand, and six cell battery compartment, as well as incorporating a guard terminal to reduce surface leakage currents that reduce accuracy at higher voltages. All instruments are over-molded for increased protection and have an IP54 weatherproof rating.
