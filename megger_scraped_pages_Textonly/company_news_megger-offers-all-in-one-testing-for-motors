Megger offers all-in-one testing for motors
Megger offers all-in-one testing for motors
Designed specifically to be fast and easy to use, the MTR105 incorporates a graphical display, and all major functions are selected with a single rotary dial. An internal memory with capacity to store 100 test results is provided and results in memory that can either be recalled to the display or downloaded to a standard USB thumb drive.
The MTR105 offers insulation resistance testing at user-selectable voltages from 50 V to 1,000 V. Test voltages are stabilised, which ensures reliable results and eliminates the risk of over-voltage damage. In addition to standard insulation tests, the MTR105 supports PI, DAR and timed tests, which can provide valuable extra information about insulation condition.
As a further aid to accurate and reliable insulation testing, the instrument features a guard terminal that can be used to help eliminate the effects of surface leakage.
For low resistance testing, the MTR105 offers a single continuous range from 0.01 Ω to 1.0 MΩ for continuity measurement. It supports four-wire testing up to 10 Ω and has a bi-directional test option that automatically reverses the current without the need to reconnect the test leads. Users can select a test current of 20 mA or 200 mA. A continuity buzzer function, with an adjustable threshold, is also provided.
The MTR105 is suitable for use in CAT III applications at supply voltages up to 600 V and incorporates an extensive range of features to maximise user safety and to protect it against accidental damage. These include live circuit detection and test inhibit features for insulation testing and continuity measurements, and default display of live circuit voltage on all ranges. The detection and inhibit functions continue to operate even if the instrument’s internal protection fuse has failed.
Featuring robust construction to ensure a long reliable service life, Megger’s new MTR105 static motor analyser has an almost indestructible weatherproof case with an IP54 ingress protection rating that includes the battery and fuse compartments. A shock-absorbing rubber over-moulding provides further protection as well as making the instrument easy to grip. As standard, the MTR105 is supplied complete with leads and a variety of clamps and probes for insulation testing, and with a Kelvin-clip lead set for use when making four-wire low-resistance measurements.
