Cable fault location with households connected
Modular multi-polar design
The SmartFuse2 (SFC2) multifunctional electronic circuit breaker system for load currents up to 250 A and is perfect for testing low voltage power grids. It tells you in advance if
a power failure will happen, keeps outage times to a minimum, and can help you locate cable faults without disconnecting the consumer from the mains!
The SFC2 replaces conventional HRC standard fuses and is compatible with NH02 and NH03 fuse holders and offers maximum flexibility through its modular multipolar design. It monitors the current and voltage progression in real time, continuously records the data, and reports events to you via the mobile phone network (GSM, 3G), WiFi,or LAN. Finally, it'll give you an early warning if the grid overload is threatened and can be configured to automatically restore the power.
