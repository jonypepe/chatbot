Data sheet -  PA2505K
Overview
Technical
Full-scale range simultaneously selected by current-range selector switch
Eliminate need to change leads
Selectable 50 % or 100 % power factor
Test single or polyphase watthour meters
New compact, heavy-duty metal carrying case
The rugged PA-2505K phantom load operates from a single-phase source and is designed for field testing single-phase and polyphase watthour meters at 50 % and 100 % power factor. A reactor is incorporated in the unit so 50 % power factor capability is provided even when only a single-phase power source is available.
This unit uses a heavy-duty selector switch in conjunction with a variable autotransformer to provide continuous adjustment of the load current - a valuable feature that permits close control of the output for different load circuit impedances or in the event of variations in the source voltage. Once all leads have been connected, a single switch simultaneously selects the desired test current and automatically routes it through the appropriate input of the reference standard. This not only eliminates the need to change leads, but also the possibility of accidentally overloading the current coil of the reference standard.
The instrument is rated for continuous duty with forced-air cooling provided by a built-in fan. Primary and secondary test leads are furnished as standard equipment. The PA-2505K comes with a compact, heavy-duty metal, two-compartment carrying case. The case features a soft grip handle and ample space for reference standard and test leads.
