Webinars
Megger webinars provide valuable educational knowledge across a number of areas include testing theory and applications, best practices, industry standards/procedures, and safety. These are FREE webinars presented by Megger’s expert Application Engineers and Product Managers, who use their experiences in the field and industry to give you a greater insight into electrical testing to help you avoid common mistakes and improve your testing.
Webinars sessions are FREE and open to all.
All registrants will receive a link to view the recording of the webinar via email. This will be sent within a week of the live presentation. If you are unable to attend the live webinar session, please register to ensure you will receive this link and can view the recording at a later time.
Each webinar is 1 hour long, followed by a 15 – 30 minute Q&A session.
During the live webinar, attendees can submit questions to the presenter/s and as many as possible will be answered during the Q&A Session.  Those questions that are not answered will be responded to individually at the conclusion of the webinar.
