Overview
Technical
Features compact long-distance directional pickup
Locates gas leaks and corona within inches of the source
Lightweight for easy use, even in remote field locations
Insensitive to high ambient audible noise levels
The Ultrasonic Leak and Corona Detector is a low-cost, portable system that receives airborne ultrasonic signals, converts them to the audible range, amplifies them, and displays the output visibly on a meter and audibly through a speaker or headset. The detector is useful wherever electrical or pressurised equipment is used. Applications include preventive maintenance in plants and utilities to locate poor or arcing connections, switches, faulty insulators, lightning arresters, power supplies, motors, and radio frequency interference sources.
The system is designed for locating gas leaks and electrical corona sources, all of which emit strong ultrasonic signals that are inaudible to the unaided human ear. Variously shaped collectors facilitate quick location of ultrasonic sources; in particular, the new directional pickup horn allows pinpointing of discharges in high voltage equipment while the operator remains at a safe distance.
With the transducer probe plugged into the instrument, you can immediately locate many ultrasonic sources by scanning with the transducer probe held as a flashlight and using the speaker or meter to detect maximum emissions. For greater sensitivity, or to further pinpoint a distant source, you can simply slip the directional horn over the transducer to concentrate the focus, permitting source location to within a 0.3-m (1 ft) circle at 9 m (30 ft).
The ultrasonic detection system consists of the instrument with an indicator and speaker, a plug-in ultrasonic transducer probe, a directional pickup horn attachment, a sound concentrator attachment, and a headset. A carrying case is also included.
