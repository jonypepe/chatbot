Megger's new PV tester shines!
Megger's new PV tester shines!
Designed specifically to aid the installation of solar PV panels, Megger's new PVM210 solar irradiance meter features a compact design which, unlike most other irradiance meters, has the solar detector on the top of the instrument. This arrangement, combined with the useful measurement hold function, makes the PVM210 easy and convenient to use - even with just one hand - when working on a sloping roof or at the top of a ladder.
Small, light and easy to use
Designed for one-handed use
Safer for use on ladders
Available as a stand alone product, or in PV specialist kits
Easy-to-read display
The pocket-sized PVM210 offers fast accurate readings of solar power and shows the result on a large easy-to-read 3¾-digit liquid crystal display. This makes the instrument ideally suited as an aid to selecting the optimum position for PV panels during installation. In addition, it can also be used in conjunction with an ammeter to verify that the short-circuit current of a PV installation matches the specification provided by the manufacturer of the PV panels. For applications where precise irradiance measurements at a specific angle or in a specific direction are required, the instrument is provided with a tripod bush that allows it to be securely mounted on any standard photographic tripod.
Long battery life
Suitable for use in all types of solar power installations, the PVM210 measures incident solar irradiance up to 1999 W/m3 (634 BTU/ft2.hour) with a typical accuracy of ± 10 W/m3 (± 3 BTU/ft2.hour). A sampling time of just 0.25 seconds ensures that accurate readings are produced almost instantly. Power for the instrument is provided by two inexpensive and readily available AAA/LR03 batteries, with a fresh set of batteries offering around 50 hours of operation. An auto-off feature helps to conserve battery life by automatically turning the instrument off if no measurements have been made for 15 minutes. Megger's new PVM210 solar irradiance meter weighs just 90 g (3 oz) and has an operating temperature range of +5 ºC to + 40 ºC. It is supplied complete with a durable protective pouch for storage and transport.
