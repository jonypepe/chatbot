Overview
Technical
Robust oil chamber lid, fully opening for easy access
Robust and protective control panel lid
Lightweight portable unit for field use
Simple, semi-automatic operation
Suitable for all oil breakdown testing to 60 kV
Automatic 1 minute timer for easy withstand testing
1ms high voltage switch off time eliminates damage to the oil samples
The OTS60SX/2 semi-automatic oil test set is a lightweight oil dielectric strength tester suitable for field use and can be powered from a range of mains supplies. The microprocessor-controlled, semi-automatic operation allows you to choose from a selection of voltage rise rates as specified in many national standards. To that end, the instrument comes with a selection of vessels suitable for testing to a wide range of national specifications. Three types of electrode are available; spherical (IEC type), mushroom (VDE/ASTM D1816), and cylindrical (ASTM D877). The oil sample can be stirred by a motor driven propeller available in some of the vessels. Spare electrodes can also be supplied suitable for all types of oil testing.
To start the test, all you need to is press the start button. If oil breakdown occurs, the instrument will remove the test voltage and display the breakdown value. Alternatively, you can pause the test voltage at any time to carry out a withstand test. The voltage will be maintained at this level for one minute or until breakdown. After one minute, the voltage will automatically continue to rise until breakdown occurs or to the maximum output of the instrument. The maximum output is 60 kV, which allows tests to be performed on oil from a wide variety of electrical installations including transformers, circuit breakers, and other equipment. As you can see, the operation of the test set is extremely simple. The results are then displayed on a bright LED screen.
The OTS60SX/2 is not only easy to use, it's also rugged and safe. A strong polycarbonate window covers the high voltage chamber and a mesh screen enables the oil breakdown to be viewed and reduces electromagnetic emissions. There is also an interlock on the chamber door that adds to your safety.
