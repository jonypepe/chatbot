Fast and precise phase identification
Saves time and money
The PVS100i phase verification system is there to help you, whether you are restructuring a network, planning new network systems, or performing switching operations. Precise phase identification is essential for the safe and reliable operation of a network and the PVS 100i can assist you at all voltage levels by checking the phase quickly, easily, and accurately. It also helps you to avoid faulty switching, eliminates safety risks, reduces operation expenses, prevents a one-sided load of the network, and improves the overall service.
The PVS100i system consists of two identical devices: the base station and the mobile unit. The difference is defined in the menu and it is easy to operate via the touch screen. The base station is connected to a known phase that serves as a reference. The phase positions at every voltage level can be identified with the mobile unit by comparing the actual phase angle with the angle of the reference phase.
Both devices are synchronised via a GSM connection and the phase assignment is displayed immediately. The GPS time signal is used to provide a highly accurate time base, which is stored for one hour via the internal cache.
The PVS100i can be used anywhere thanks to its built-in rechargeable battery. The system is directly connected to the test object at network voltages of up to 400 V. At higher voltages of up to 120 kV, the test is performed using a high voltage sensor that communicates with the PVS100i mobile unit via bidirectional wireless.
The bright LEDs on the voltage sensor (which are even visible in sunlight) signal its activation as well as the phase identification. This makes it unnecessary to have visual contact with the mobile unit during the test and you can keep your eyes on the sensor. The measured data can be saved immediately on a USB stick.
