Overview

This product has now been discontinued. Please see
BM5200
and
MIT515
as alternatives.
Four test voltages to 5 kV
Dual power supply option giving the best of both worlds: BM15 is battery powered, MJ15 is hand-cranked with optional battery power
Resilient mounted analogue scale for robustness
Voltage range to 600 V indicates auto discharge
Pass/fail overlays for rapid testing
Single scale for insulation values to avoid operator error
The BM15 and MJ15 analogue 5 kV insulation testers are compact are very simple to use and provide a quick and accurate reading of insulation resistance. The instruments use an analogue display with a maximum reading of 20 GΩ.
These instruments give you a choice of power source. The BM15 is powered by 8 x LR6 (AA) alkaline battery cells, whereas the MJ15 comes with a hand-cranked generator as well as batteries. If the test button is pressed, the MJ15 uses battery power, otherwise the crank handle is turned to save battery power or for use when the batteries are unavailable.
Both instruments are easy to operate; a voltage range enables measurement of AC or DC conductor potential. Four test voltages are also available at 500 V, 1 kV, 2.5 kV, and 5 kV. A choice of push buttons is supplied with the instruments; a locking button to simplify long term testing, or a non-locking version if preferred for maximum safety.
The BM15 and MJ15 feature a bezel that allows a scale plate overlay to be added with pass/fail bands for go/no go testing. This is particularly useful if you are less experienced at using this kind of instrument and enables a rapid decision to be made.
Both units are built into a rugged case designed for outdoor use and are also supplied with a soft carrying case, a test lead set, test record cards, and batteries.
