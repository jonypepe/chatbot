Data sheet -  DLRO10 wind turbine test leads
Overview
Technical
Developed in conjunction with a leading manufacturer of wind turbines
Allows easy and reliable measurement of lightning protection circuit resistance of wind turbines
Available in three lengths, 30 m, 60 m, and 100 m to suit both manufacturing and maintenance applications
Long cable fitted on strong metal framed cable reel
Cable reel fitted with friction brake to avoid tangles when paying out cable EMFs
Uses duplex connect test lead system
The KC series test leads are wind turbine lightning protection test lead sets that provide a complete and convenient solution to the problem of finding reliable test leads that are long enough for testing the continuity of lightning protection conductors in wind turbines, either in part in a production environment, or fully assembled during commissioning, maintenance, or following repair.
This lead set is designed to be connected to any instruments in the Megger 10 A DLRO range or the Megger BT51. However, for outside use the DLRO10HD is recommended due to its robustness and high IP rating.
The KC series of wind turbine test leads are available in 100 m, 60 m, and 30 m (330 ft, 200 ft, and 100 ft) versions that are equally suitable for use on site or in the manufacturing plant. All lead set versions are 10 A rated.
The lead sets consist of two test leads. The first is a 5 m (16 ft) cable fitted with a duplex handspike for probing the lightning receptors on the tips of the turbine blades. The second cable is either a 30 m, 60 m, or 100 m (100 ft, 200 ft, or 330 ft) cable, fitted with a large robust Kelvin clip, specially designed to offer ease of use while providing the consistently reliable connections needed to ensure accurate and repeatable test results.
The long cable is wound onto a high quality, robust cable reel fitted with a friction brake to avoid tangles while paying out
