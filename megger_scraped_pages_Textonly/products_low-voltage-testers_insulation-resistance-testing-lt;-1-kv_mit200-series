The MIT200 series of pocket-sized insulation and continuity testers are among the most compact insulation testers available on the market today. With options of one, two, and three test voltage instruments, the MIT200 series offers a surprising range of safety and operational features.
The display uses a combination of digital readout and analogue display, using Megger’s patented DART technology. This means it includes the benefits of an LCD display, such as clear, accurate measurement and precise readings, with an analogue pointer response for evaluating circuit charge and discharge characteristics
The MIT200 series is ideal for testing transformers, motors, generators, switchgear, panel building, domestic appliances, power tools, etc., as well as fixed electrical wiring systems. Their small size and light weight make them ideal for those engineers that need to carry them for extended periods.
