Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source on the planet, and in the past decade, the solar power market in North America has practically doubled every year. With over 2.6 million solar installations – ranging from rooftop solar panels for your home to large-scale solar systems powering our utilities – there’s enough clean electricity to power over 16 million homes. As more and more North Americas rely on solar power, Megger is committed to providing the electrical test equipment needed to install, maintain, and troubleshoot your solar systems – keeping the solar power on.
Megger’s pocket-size solar irradiance meter (
PVM210
) is ideal for choosing optimal photovoltaic panel position during installation. Paired with a multimeter or clamp meter, Megger’s Photovoltaic Kits (
PVK320
,
PVK330
) are perfect for installing, commissioning, and testing solar installations – enabling electricians or engineers to verify the stated short circuit current. The
DCM1500S
, Megger’s newest solar clamp meter, is designed for installing, maintaining, monitoring, and checking large AC or DC solar power systems and equipment. With a large clear display, along with up to 1500 A of current, the
DCM1500S
easily measures voltage, current, resistance, diode, capacitance, temperature and frequency. Pairing with the free Megger Link App, the
DCM1500S
can remotely monitor measurements with built-in Bluetooth – giving a live trended graph on a paired smart device. For certain solar power systems, the
MIT430/2
CATIV insulation tester is the ideal instrument solar installation testing. When 1kV isn’t enough, Megger offers the
MIT2500
, a handheld, lightweight insulation tester that can produce up to 2,500 Vdc for testing insulation resistance in PV systems.
With constantly fluctuating outputs, power quality issues can often arise in solar systems. With the Megger
MPQ1000
Power Quality Analyzer, you can easily troubleshoot power quality issues within your solar installation’s battery banks, inverters, switches, breaker or fuse boxes, and electric meters. For locating cable faults in isolated solar panel strings from the solar array cables back to the inverter, the Megger
TDR2050
and
TDR2010
are the perfect solution. When it comes to troubleshooting solar issues, a TDR is the ideal time-saving solution for any solar technician or engineer. If your solar installation has a battery bank, you may want to look into adding Megger's thermal imaging camera (
TC3231
) to your tool arsenal, as well. The TC3231 can quickly identify hotspots, compared to traditional battery testing procedures. Compact and handheld –  the TC3231 is a great tool for solar troubleshooting, especially in tight or hard to reach spaces.
Likewise, if you're maintaining a large solar installation with a battery bank, the Megger
BITE2
or
BITE3
Battery Impedance Testers can help you determine the health of your battery cells by taking measurements of the most important battery parameters.
Make sure you’re effectively grounded and meeting spec with Megger ground testers. With a live trace feature, the Megger
DET2/3
, can make dynamic measurements over time to indicate instability on the system. With added data storage, graphical results and supreme noise suppression, plus ruggedized construction for field operation, it is the most advanced ground tester on the market. With the
DET24C
clamp-on ground tester, you can verify that your system is safely grounded, meets Code and any other imposed standards without having to extend long test leads or expend valuable time. Just clamp, push button, and read result.
Reduce and eliminate the major time-consuming hassle in ground resistance testing, with the
ETK
Earth Test Kit No more wires strewn randomly about the site. No more hand retrieval and nuisance tangling. Stored on convenient wind-up reels, the leads are easy to pay out and retrieve, with no tangling. Available in 3 different lengths, the reels can be daisy-chained to any distance.

DLRO2X
Wind power in the United States is another rapidly expanding sector of clean energy – providing more power than any other renewable energy source in the United States and producing enough energy annually to offset the power consumption of nearly 30 million average homes in America each year. With a three-bladed rotor design and connection to medium, wind turbines convert wind energy into electrical energy and feed it into medium and high voltage systems. Megger manufactures a range of electrical testers for the wind market, including motor, low resistance, and insulation testers.
Megger’s range of digital low resistance ohmmeters, including the newest
DLRO2
/ DLRO2X
and
DLRO10 Series
, are ideal for testing busbar connection in windfarm networks. The
DLRO2
has the added ability to test with very long test leads – perfect for verifying lightning protection on wind turbines. For testing a wind turbine’s motor insulation, Megger offers the
MTR105
a lightweight, handheld motor and insulation tester with four-wire low resistance, temperature correction, and voltage measurement.

Megger Electric Vehicle Charger Checker
EVCC300
The demand for electric vehicles continues to increase rapidly. Manufacturers of these vehicles and EV supply equipment (EVSE) are working hard in an effort to meet the latest uptick in demand. However, because the EV market is relatively new and is still not well-regulated, there are some inherent issues. One is the need for charging points, which can be few and far between. This is a worry for drivers of EVs because there is no guarantee of when and where they will be able to charge next. This has caused a ground swell of installations of new EV charging stations for public use across the country.
Chargers need to go through routine inspections. These inspections help to assess their safety and alert the inspector if maintenance needs to be performed. Assessments include checking for hazardous voltages, confirming there is a suitable ground connection, ensuring that any exposed metal work is properly grounded, certifying that the charger ground does not rise to a hazardous level when the charger output is on and timing the charger’s safety device’s tripping speed. Inspectors can also check to see if nuisance tripping or GFCI is likely to occur. But to perform any of these inspections, it is important to have the right equipment, like
Megger’s EVCC300
. An all-in-one tool that makes checking EV charge points quick and easy.
