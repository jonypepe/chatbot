Megger's product innovation and development
Megger's product innovation and development
A passion for the business of test and measurement
Our passion for business is most clearly shown by a focus on execution – making things happen and learning more. You can see evidence of this in the range of new products made available to you in recent years.
We devote enthusiasm to improving even the most minor technical details. With a truly massive product range, a programme of innovation and geographic proximity to customers, you gain from Megger’s innovation strategy. Most companies appreciate innovation’s benefits, but far fewer actively pursue it because of fear of failure. Megger’s culture and financial systems are aligned to ensure a steady flow of innovative products. Sales, product management and engineering functions follow a New Product Innovation process, which focuses on a marketing philosophy known as ‘Voice of the customer’. It provides you with market led, customer founded innovation.
Maintaining high growth is driven by investment in technology as well as by sales and marketing strategy. Long term Megger believes that the best way to secure good quality products and intellectual property is through excellence in engineering and its production facilities. Key processes and expertise are kept in-house. Engineering teams are located on-site at all the company’s factories. Advanced manufacturing technology, including automatic wave solder machinery and robotic surface mount technology helps keep costs down and quality up.
