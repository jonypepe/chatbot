Overview
Technical
LED clockwise and anti-clockwise phase rotation indication
Audible indication of direction
Phase condition LEDs
Fused test leads
Crocodile clips and prods provided
Dual phase colour identification
The PSI410 Phase sequence indicator can let you know quickly if the phase sequence is correct using a triple bi-coloured LED display and a specific audible tone. The triple bi-coloured LED display indicates that all three phases are present; a green LED indicates the phase is present, while a red LED shows a missing phase connection.
The unit has a tough rugged case designed for an industrial environment and is supplied with long fused test leads with crocodile clips and prods. The prods have insulated tips that provide less than 4 mm exposed tip. The PSI410 is self-powered from the supply and requires no batteries.
The PSI410 is an ideal addition to an electrician’s tool kit where currently owned test instruments do not feature phase rotation. The unit provides a quick and simple means of checking phase sequence on motor, pump, and three-phase air conditioning supplies.
