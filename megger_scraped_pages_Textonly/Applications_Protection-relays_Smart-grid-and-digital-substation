Smart and specialised test solutions for IEC 61850 networks
Software, data communication and control, etc, are standard in modern substations. Through the development and implementation of IEC 61850 since the mid-2000s, the way to design, configure, and run substations has changed. This IT influence brings with it many advantages, but it also introduces new challenges to the industry.
General view
In the digital substation, the analogue signals and proprietary one-to-one connections between IEDs and network sensors have evolved to data networks and data streams.
IEC 61850, with its abstract data models defined, can be mapped to several protocols: MMS (Manufacturing Message Specification), GOOSE (Generic Object-Oriented System Event), and SMV (Sampled Measured Values).

IEC61850 Solutions
Latest Technical Content
The IEC 61850 interface relay testers, FREJA and SMRT together with the software MGC Megger GOOOSE Configurator, and SVA Sampled Values Analyser, are the solutions used to test and troubleshoot IEC 61850 communication, both, GOOSE and process bus. Features like IEC 61850 sniffer, merge and compare, are cyber secure solutions that saves time and increase quality. Read more about Megger test solutions here
Tests performed virtually with the SMRT digital twin (are we promoting this on launch?) removes errors and uncertainties upfront before entering the often time pressured commissioning phase. A small subset of those tests would have to be repeated in the real world to verify physical connections and that correct settings are loaded into the relays. There are many other areas beside commissioning where benefits are seen such as FAT, training, support, development to mention a few. Read more in detail in the
digital twin article
and the
IEEE paper
on the same topic.

DIGITAL SUBSTATION INCURSION
Smart test solutions for digital substations
Protection tests with IEC 61850
In digital substations, the conventional trip contacts are replaced by a GOOSE message and the conventional analogue voltages and currents are replaced by Sampled Values (SV) generated by Merging Units (MU).

Intuitive GOOSE configuration
GOOSE configuration can be a complex task. In MGC that configuration is optimised by ‘click-to-subscribe’ to map the appropriate GOOSE message to a binary input or output.

Merge and compare
Easily detect differences between the design and the actual status of the GOOSE traffic by comparing it with its description in the SCD file. Smart grouping and highlighted differences also give a superb overview.

Click and merge
Easily detect differences between the design and the actual status of the GOOSE traffic by comparing it with its description in the SCD file. Smart grouping and highlighted differences also give a superb overview.
Secure access point
Connecting a PC to the substation network is not without its risks. However, the SMRT and FREJA units provide a secure access point to the substation network, and therefore cannot transmit ‘false’ data, nor infect the network with a virus. This is also known as the GOOSE ‘diode’.

Secure access point
Non intrusive sniffer
The sniffer function ensure that nothing is transmitted and that all GOOSE traffic is captured and grouped for good overview. If a GOOSE change status is it highlighted so it is easy to detect changes.

Onboard IEC 61850 capability
With all IEC 61850 capabilities available from the on-board touch screen, there is no need for a PC. No PC connection issues, no software license issues, and no risk of transmitting viruses to the substation network.

MRCT
The Megger MRCT is a light weight, robust, portable unit used toperform demagnetization, ratio, saturation, winding resistance, polarity, phasedeviation, and insulation tests on current transformers. The MRCT automaticallycalculates ratio errors, saturation curves, and knee points. The MRCT providesa microprocessor-controlled variable voltage and current output and precisioninstrumentation for automatically testing single and multi ratio CTs, reducingtesting time and increasing productivity. The MRCT will directly connect tomulti ratio CT’s and perform all tests – saturation, ratio and polarity,winding resistance and insulation – on all taps with the push of a button andwithout changing leads.
Industry leading test duration using patented simultaneous multi-tap measurements reduces testing time by 20% on multi-tap CTs
Increased measurement accuracy to support metering class CT testing
Smallest and lightest 2kV secondary voltage injection unit on the market
Integrated single phase relay test system
General purpose substation secondary circuit testing with 300V & 60A generators
Grouped testing: demagnetization, knee points, ratios, saturation curves, and more

A little touch-up animation for the paragraph that reveals on expand
To make things a little livelier, I added a nice little touch up to the paragraph by creating a slide in animation from below. So, instead of being still upon expand, it will slide in from below nicely.
Additional interaction to create focus/highlight on specific item (Optional)
I added a focus/highlight effect to make the item that's on hover stands out from the rest. This helps the user to focus on the item that they are reading.
This is definitely optional. You can remove this animation from the interaction setting. It's a separate interaction from the expand/collapse.
