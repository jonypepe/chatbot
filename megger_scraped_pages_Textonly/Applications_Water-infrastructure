CORRELUX C-3
The Correlux C-3 correlator locates leaks in drinking water pipes. Pressurized water at the leak location creates a noise which travels out in all directions of the pipe. This noise is recorded, amplified and sent wirelessly to the correlator by two sensors (piezo microphone, hydrophone) which are attached to the pipe (e.g. valve, hydrants). The Correlux C-3 compares both signals (correlation) and calculates the exact distance to the leakage on the basis of the delay time of the signals, the sensor distance and the sound velocity in the pipe.

HYDROLUX HL 7000
The HL 7000 ground noise system provides you with a wide range of options for locating leaks thanks to the variable design and the automatic 360° sensor recording. Work assignments lasting more than 10 hours are no problem thanks to the powerful lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. The Bluetooth
®
capable, wind-protected piezoelectric ground microphone with integrated pre-amplification clearly picks up extremely low leakage frequencies on soft materials such as PVC or PE, and also high frequencies on steel or cast iron pipes.
