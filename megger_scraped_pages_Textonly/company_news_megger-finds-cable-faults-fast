Megger finds cable faults fast
Megger finds cable faults fast
Offering compatibility with virtually all types of paired metallic cables, comprehensive dual-channel operation, auto set up for instant use and excellent near-end fault location performance, as well as internal storage for up to 100 traces, the new TDR2000/3 time domain reflectometer from Megger is the ideal choice for rapidly, reliably and conveniently locating cable faults in telecommunications and street lighting systems.
Comprehensive dual-channel capability with dual aspect display
Auto set-up mode for instant use
Ultra fast pulse for near-end fault identification
Xpert guidance to potential fault
IP54 rating offers real-life working
Designed for use on all metallic paired cables
Highly technically competent
The large high-resolution backlit colour display used in the TDR2000/3 is complemented by directional control buttons and soft keys that aim to make operating the instrument easy and intuitive. Dual cursors allow instant measurement of the distance between any two points on the traces, while the trace comparison feature makes it easy to spot even small differences between two simultaneously displayed traces.
To ensure precise fault location, the TDR2000/3 it has a minimum resolution of just 0.1 m, and its maximum range is up to 20 km, depending on the type of cable and velocity factor selected. Velocity factors from 0.2 to 0.99 are supported, allowing the instrument to deliver accurate results with any type of cable, and a choice of five output impedances from 25 Ω to 125 Ω is offered, together with an automatic impedance matching function.
Fast to the fault
The time-saving auto set-up option automatically sets the most suitable operating parameters for the instrument depending on the range selected, aiding rapid fault diagnosis. The automatic settings can, however, be easily overridden allowing operation of the instrument to be manually fine-tuned when dealing with particularly challenging faults.
Megger’s unique Xpert mode is further invaluable aid to fault location. A single press of the Xpert key automatically adjusts the range and gain of the instrument, and positions the cursor over the first major event on the cable. Subsequent key presses move the cursor, one event at a time, to the positions of other major events on the cable.
Tough enough for real world working
Compact yet robustly built, the Megger TDR2000/3 dual-channel time-domain reflectometer has an IP54 ingress protection rating, which means that it is well protected against the vagaries of on-site use. It has CAT IV 150 V and CAT III 300 V safety ratings, in line with IEC 61010.
A copy of Megger’s TraceXpert PC software is supplied as standard with every TDR2000/3. Designed around a powerful database and configured for ease of use and simplicity, this versatile software package gives users full control over data download from the instrument, as well as providing powerful reporting facilities.
