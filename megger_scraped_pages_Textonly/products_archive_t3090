Overview
Software
The MTDR300 has been discontinued and is being replaced by the Teleflex SX-1
0-25,000 ft continuous
Automatic or manual range selection
Optional sectionalizing
Using a radar to pre-locate faults will save time and reduce cable damage. The T3090 is designed to be the most user-friendly radar on the market! Advanced features include one button operation, automatic gain and a large color screen. The T3090 will automatically ‘read’ the cable and display the fault distance with a single thump. The interactive ‘Step-By-Step Easy Mode’ will help train (or re-train) the occasional user while he is on the job! The optional ‘Sectionalize Mode’ will quickly sectionalize faults in loops or radial systems.
