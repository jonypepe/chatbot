Overview
Technical
ICEplus for the easy and reliable fault pre-location without interference from branches
High surge energy for pinpointing
Compact and lightweight construction
Testing up to 5 kV
Automatic detection of the breakdown voltage
Pinpointing with the integrated surge generator 0 … 2/4 kV 1000 J
Pulsed DC for sheath fault pinpointing
The SPG 5-1000 5 kV fault locating system is a portable multi-functional system for cable testing, fault conditioning, pre-locating, and pinpointing the location of faults in low voltage distribution systems.
Using the patented ICEplus pre-location method, the SPG 5-1000 is an easy-to-use tool for the pre-location of faults, especially in branched low voltage distribution systems. The evaluation of a reflection measurement is not required and the fault distance is directly displayed as a numerical value. The branches have no influence on the measurement.
The unit is controlled by the integrated rotary encoder and a graphic LCD for the visualisation of modes and adjusted parameters. The system supports easy handling, successful operation, even for untrained users, and provides maximum technical safety.
