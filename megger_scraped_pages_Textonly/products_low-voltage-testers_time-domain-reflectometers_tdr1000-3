Overview
Technical
Simple operation
AUTO set up for instant use
Ultra fast pulse for near end fault identification
Trace HOLD feature to allow comparison between cables
IP54 rating offers real life working
Designed for use on all metallic cable pairs
The TDR1000/3 advanced handheld time domain reflectometer (TDR) is a compact, single-channel TDR with mini clip test leads for locating faults on metallic cables. It has a minimum resolution of 0.1 m and a 5 km maximum range depending on velocity factor selected and cable type.
Four output impedances are available (25, 50, 75, and 100 Ω) and a velocity factor between 0.2 and 0.99 will meet any cable test requirements. What's more, the TDR1000 has a simple selection option which, together with a four-way control switch, makes it incredibly intuitive to use.
The TDR1000/3 has two significant features: its AUTO selection option and its trace HOLD feature. The AUTO selection ensures the most effective parameters are selected, depending on the range required, making testing the TDR trace quick and effecient. The trace HOLD feature allows you to compare between conditions - something not seen on most other handheld TDRs - and a live trace overlay feature gives you the ability to compare two traces in real time.
