The RTMS Relay Test Management Software, is the culmination of over 35 years of automatic relay testing experience. The RTMS is a Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3/Vista/7/8/10 compatible software program designed to manage all aspects of protective relay testing using the Megger SMRT series of units. The same software also runs on the Smart Touch View Interface (STVI), the handheld controller for the SMRT series.
Every SMRT unit comes with RTMS software for installing on a PC. It does not require a security dongle or license to operate, and can be loaded on as many customer owned PCs as required. The RTMS comes with two different levels: Standard and Enhanced.
The Standard level includes the manual test screen, semi-automatic and automatic tests for simple and advanced ramping, pickup and timing of overcurrent, undervoltage and overvoltage relays, directional overcurrent, sequence tests for reclosing and transient earth/ground fault simulation, impedance (both generic and relay specific from various manufacturers), and three-phase current differential. It also comes with the ability to perform special test applications with features such as the fault calculator, harmonics generator, symmetrical components, simplified power swing, and much more. Not only that, but it also includes a
Relay Library
with over 300 specific relays from 31 different relay manufacturers.
The Enhanced level
is hardware-enabled when connected to a test set that has the RTMS Enhanced feature enabled (see the SMRT Ordering Information for details). The Enhanced level includes tests for synchroniser, under/over, and df/dt (ROCOF), frequency relay pickup and timing tests, IEEE/IEC COMTRADE Transient Waveform playback, enhanced power swing/out-of-step simulator, SSI file converter and playback, and IEC 61850 Megger GOOSE Configurator (MGC).
