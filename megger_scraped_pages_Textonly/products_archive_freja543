The FREJA 543 relay test system is a multipurpose, light, portable instrument designed for the secondary testing of protection relays. It can be operated either manually, via the built-in touch screen user interface running FREJA Local software, or placed under full computer control via the FREJA Win software. The built-in user interface is Megger’s second generation of automatic/semi-automatic manual user interface.
The large, easy to read Full Colour high resolution, high definition, TFT LCD touch screen display allows you to perform manual, steady-state, and dynamic testing quickly and easily. FREJA Local includes built-in preset test routines for automatic testing of protection relays and protection schemes. Menu screens and touch screen function buttons are provided to quickly and easily select the desired test function.
Tests and test results can be saved in FREJA Local memory and downloaded to a USB drive for test data transfer or to print test reports. For full automatic testing on a PC, each FREJA unit comes with an install version of FREJA Remote. FREJA Remote is the FREJA Local software designed to run on a PC with Windows 10 operating system. FREJA Win software is an optional software program for FREJA customers who want to continue to use the legacy FREJA Win software with a PC. The FREJA Win software includes a number of instrument programs to test virtually any protection.
