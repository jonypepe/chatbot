Overview
Technical
Software
Ability to test both VTs and CTs
Easy to use one-button automated test plans
Industry-leading test duration using patented simultaneous tap measurements
Smallest and lightest unit on the market
CT knee points up to 30 kV
CT grouped testing includes demagnetisation, knee points, ratios, saturation curves, winding resistances, polarities and phase deviation (on all taps of multi-ratio CTs)
VT testing including demagnetisation, ratio, winding resistance, polarity and phase deviation
Performs secondary burden tests
Integrated 1 kV DC insulation test system
The MVCT VT and CT test set is a lightweight, portable, and robust unit capable of accurately testing both current and voltage transformers. It weighs less than 20 lb (10Kg) and is capable of performing saturation, ratio, polarity, winding resistance, and insulation tests on current transformers, and can also be used for testing metering and protection class voltage/potential transformers.
The MVCT provides a microprocessor-controlled variable voltage and current output along with precision instrumentation for automatically testing single and multi-ratio CTs and VTs. When it comes to CTs, this instrument makes testing easy. It will directly connect to multi-ratio CTs and perform all tests – saturation, ratio, polarity, winding resistance, and insulation – on all taps at the push of a button and without changing leads. This greatly reduces testing time.
The MVCT can be operated via its large, full colour, high resolution, daylight-readable TFT LCD touch screen display. This interface allows you to perform manual and automatic testing quickly and easily, and you can use the pre-constructed test routines to make testing even easier. The large colour display also enables you to easily read all pertinent data while the test is being performed and gives you the ability to view the results when the test is complete. The unit can also be configured to come without a display and thus be controlled via a laptop using Megger's PowerDB software or with Megger’s existing Smart Touch View Interface™(STVI).
