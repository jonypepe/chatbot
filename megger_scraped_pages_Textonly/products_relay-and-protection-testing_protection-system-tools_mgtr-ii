Overview
Technical
Software
Small and lightweight
Easy to use programmable output pulse for synchronized end-to-end testing
100 ns accuracy within minutes of startup, 12-channel GPS timing receiver
Near-rubidium stability during temporary GPS signal loss
IRIG-B serial time code output
Standard one pulse-per-second (PPS) output
Event time tag (ETT) time stamp with 100 ns resolution
The MGTR-II GPS timing reference is a small, lightweight, field portable, GPS satellite receiver system specifically designed to perform end-to-end tests of line protection schemes with Megger SMRT, MPRT, and PULSAR relay test systems. The MGTR-II provides a precise programmed output pulse (POP), with 100 nanoseconds of resolution. This output pulse provides a trigger synchronisation of two or more SMRT, MPRT, or PULSAR test systems to less than ±1 µ Sec of the Universal Time Coordinated (UTC).
The MGTR-II consists of a 12-channel GPS timing receiver integrated with proprietary microprocessor-controlled timing and interface logic and can track all available GPS satellites. The microprocessor-controlled timing and interface logic derives precise timing information. In addition, the MGTR-II provides a standard 1 Pulse Per Second (PPS), and ASCII serial time message, external event time-tag, an IRIG-B serial time code output signal and, most importantly, a programmable output pulse for performing end-to-end tests.
The unit comes with a 50 foot (15.2 m) long cable and all-weather, high performance, high noise immunity antenna with an integrated low noise preamplifier. The antenna comes with a 4 inch tall antenna mount.
You can control the MGTR-II through a standard RS-232 serial connection and the software provided, which also enables you to control and communicate with the unit.
