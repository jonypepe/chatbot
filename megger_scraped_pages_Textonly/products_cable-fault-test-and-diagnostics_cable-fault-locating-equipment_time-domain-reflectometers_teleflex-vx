The Teleflex VX reflectometer is the latest development in the Teleflex series. As with all Teleflex reflectometers, the VX is specially designed for the rapid processes of power cable fault location. The new hardware offers significantly improved parameters including sampling rate, pulse width, and pulse amplitude resulting in a wider range up to 1000 km, higher resolution and above all, improved measurement.
The ProRange function allows for range-based gain adjustments, displaying distant reflections with the same amplitude as from short distances. Data can be easily transferred using the USB drive using either the MeggerBook Cable software format or a PDF, or it can be sent directly to a printer.
Measuring hardware and display are separated and communicate via Ethernet. This allows for easy integration into a fault location system and allows it to be operate in offshore applications, for example, in the remote operation in ROVs.

MeggerBook & MeggerBook Lite Software Version 3.3.0
The setup file below is suitable for the installation of both MeggerBook (full version) and MeggerBook Lite (free limited version).
When started with after adding the electronic license key into the installed software, the software starts as MeggerBook full version
which allows for easy and comprehensive data evaluation, data archiving, cable management and report creation. A personal quotation for a certain number of licenses can be requested
here
. The new electronic license key allows for 3 devices to have MeggerBook full version installed on them.
Without the required software license key the software starts as MeggerBook Lite
which allows for seamless report creation and offers some of the features as the full version while limiting the data storage options as follows:
•  Measurements, analyses and reports are not permanently stored in the database
•  While cable import and storage are not limited, a maximum of 5 cables can be created using the cable editor  of the Lite Edition
At this time, the software can handle the measurement and test data of the following Megger devices:
Test vans:            Centrix, Centrix City, Compact City, R30, Variant
Test systems:     VLF Sine Wave 45 / 62, VLF CR 40/60, TDS 40/60
TDRs:                     Teleflex VX(-P), Teleflex SX
Note for test systems VLF Sine Wave 45 and VLF Sine Wave 62
:
Data of these test systems can only be imported into the software, if the test systems is equipped with firmware version 3.14 or higher. The latest firmware can be found
here
(VLF Sine Wave 45) and
here
(VLF Sine Wave 62).
