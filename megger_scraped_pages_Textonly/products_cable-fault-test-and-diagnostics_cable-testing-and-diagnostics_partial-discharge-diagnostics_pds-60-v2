Data sheet -  PDS 60-v2
Overview
Technical
Software
Suitable for DAC, VLF CR, and VLF Sinusoidal power sources up to 60 kV RMS
Real-time data evaluation and display of results, no post-processing needed
General and localised phase resolved PD pattern (PRPD) display for defect type recognition
The PDS 60-v2 portable partial discharge (PD) detection and localisation system has been designed for all Megger VLF sinusoidal, cosine rectangular, and damped AC power sources up to 60 kVRMS. The PDS 60-v2 comes with all the accessories needed to perform PD measurements, like the in-house and certified PD calibrator, laptop, and connection cables.
It's PD detector software makes it easier than ever to perform PD measurements, enabling you to get real-time data analysis and display of results during the actual measurement, and giving you the flexibilty to create customised reports.
Furthermore, the PD detector software will support you with data evaluation by means of Phase Resolved Partial Discharge (PRPD) patterns. With help from these PRPD patterns, you can distinguish between different types of PD defects, such as corona or internal PD. This is of major importance for partial discharges located at terminations as corona discharges are not problematic, unlike internal PD.
