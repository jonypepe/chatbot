The MET1000 All-in-one true RMS electrical tester is a multifunctional voltage and current tester that gives electricians and electrical engineers a versatile and robust handheld meter with detachable test leads. Featuring both LED and LCD displays, it gives you a 200 A AC and 1000 V AC/DC tester designed for everyday use. CATIV 600 V/CATIII 1000 V rated, with an IP65 housing for added protection, it reduces the number of testers required in the professional’s tool bag.
In addition to the unit's adaptable auto-ranging voltage and continuity tests, the Megger MET1000 has a built-in current clamp for AC current measurement to 200 A. With true RMS AC measurements, a phase rotation test, and single pole voltage test built in, the MET1000 is a truly multi-purpose electrical test instrument, ideal for use in commercial, industrial, and domestic environments. It even comes with GS38 shrouds, provided as standard, to ensure compliance with the latest standards.
The instrument includes a bright LED torch to aid in safety when working in poorly lit conditions, and has a protective finger guard incorporated into its protective casing. This combined with its ergonomic design, carrying holster, and it's easy-to-use probe mounting on the rear of the tester, all help to keep the user safe and the instrument protected.
