The DLRO-H200 handheld 200 A micro-ohmmeter is designed to measure the resistance of circuit breaker contacts, busbar joints, and other high current links. This product is designed with safety, ease of use, and versatility in mind. This micro-ohmmeter can be used anywhere to measure a low resistance value with high accuracy.
With the DLRO-H200 it is possible to make measurements according to the DualGround™ method. This means that the test object will be grounded on both sides throughout the test giving a safer, faster, and easier workflow.
Ruggedness and light weight make the handheld DLRO-H200 very suitable for field work, substations, and similar locations. The unit also comes with a strong rubber holster that makes it extra durable. The DLRO-H200 is designed to carry out a full day of testing without recharge and it can store 190 test values and transfer test data to a PC via Bluetooth. The Bluetooth feature can also be used in conjunction with the wireless headset (supplied) to provide an audible pass/fail signal against user adjustable limits as tests are performed.
DLRO-H200 Micro-ohmmeters are supplied as standard with a copy of the PowerDB Lite software package. This intuitive software offers powerful features for storing, analyzing and archiving test results, and it supports reporting a wide range of industry standard formats. It also makes it easy to integrate results from the DLRO-H200 with results from other instruments to produce uniform reports.
