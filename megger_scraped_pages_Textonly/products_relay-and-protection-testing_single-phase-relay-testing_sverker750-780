The engineer’s toolbox for all single phase relay testing
Standalone functionality
Rugged and reliable for field use
The SVERKER 750 and SVERKER 780 relay test sets are the engineer's toolbox. The control panel features a logical layout, so SVERKER 650 users will find it comfortably familiar and will be able to start work right away. These instruments are intended primarily for secondary testing of protective relay equipment. Virtually all types of single-phase protection can be tested. You can also test three-phase protection by testing one phase at a time, as well as a number of protective relay systems that require phase shifting, and automatic reclosing devices.
These instruments feature many functions that make relay testing more efficient. For example, they have a powerful measurement section that can display, in addition to time, voltage, and current, Z, R, X, S, P, Q, phase angle, and cos φ. The voltmeter can also be used as a second ammeter (when testing differential relays, for example). All values are presented on a single easy-to-read display.
You can also test directional protective equipment efficiently by means of the built-in variable voltage source. In the SVERKER 780, this has a continuous phase shift function and adjustable frequency as well, and automatic reclosing devices can also be tested just as easily.
Since the compact SVERKER weighs only 18 kg (39 lbs), it’s easy to move from site to site. Two or more SVERKER units can also be synchronised, which allows you to operate a basic three-phase test set.
Designed to comply with EU standards and other personal and operational safety standards, the SVERKER 750 and SVERKER 780 are also equipped with a serial port for communication with personal computers and the PC software SVERKER Win.

Please note: To control and communicate with the SVERKER 750/780, the SVERKER needs to have a license installed. To install and view the software only, no license is required.
