Overview
Technical
Software
Provides reliable and accurate test results in noisy high voltage substations
Five standard models
Modular design for customized configuration
Full stand-alone functionality or data acquisition models without user interface.
Faster and safer testing with DualGround™, both sides of breaker are grounded
On-screen assistance with connection diagrams and test template wizard
All models can be controlled via computer
The TM1700 series of circuit breaker test systems use the ground breaking technology from the top-of-the-line TM1800 series. There are five models in the TM1700 series (TM1710, TM1720, TM1740, TM1750, and TM1760) and they can all be operated as standalone units or from a PC using the data management and analysing software CABA Win.
The TM1700 series are robust on the outside with powerful technology on the inside, enabling you to achieve efficient and reliable circuit breaker testing in challenging environments. Indeed, all inputs and outputs on the instruments are designed to withstand the challenging environment in high voltage substations and industrial environments. What's more, galvanically isolated inputs and outputs make it possible to perform all relevant measurements in one test, so you don't need to create a new setup and reconnect the unit for each one. The TM1700 series works well using the DualGround method, making testing safe and saving you time by keeping the circuit breaker grounded on both sides throughout the test.
The timing measurement inputs use an active interference suppression algorithm to ensure correct timing and accurate PIR (Pre-Insertion Resistor) values, even at high capacitively coupled interference currents. The adaptive and easy-to-use software allows you to perform the test by simply turning the test switch without the need for settings. Thanks to this software, you're also only one click away from advanced help functions, such as connection diagrams, which can be clearly viewed on the 8-inch colour touch screen. There is also an on-screen keyboard that allows you to navigate the interface and operate it as a standalone unit.
