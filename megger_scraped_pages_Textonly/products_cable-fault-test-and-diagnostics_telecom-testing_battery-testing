With the increasing dependency of back up systems on battery strings, and the escalating cost of replacing batteries, instrumentation and software systems that can measure, trend and manage the life-cycle of cells is a cost effective option.
There are two methodologies for testing batteries.
The first, impedance testing is an on line test and can be performed frequently to identify individual weak cells before they fail.
The second, battery discharge test is, normally, an off-line test and tests the actual output of the whole battery under load conditions. This will show what will actually happen if the battery is required to take the load.
Most battery systems are floating and have earth leakage monitors and trips if there is an earth fault. The Battery Ground Fault Tracer allows you to trace a faulty circuit easily in a complex floating system.
