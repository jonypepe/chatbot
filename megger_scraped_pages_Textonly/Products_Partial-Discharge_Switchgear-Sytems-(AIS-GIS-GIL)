Switchgear
Overview
Power Diagnostix range of instruments cover the entire needs of partial discharge testing on gas or air insulated substation equipment from acceptance testing and commissioning to maintenance and monitoring.

Applications

Switchgear Systems (AIS/GIS/GIL)
Switchgear
Partial discharge measurements are used to validate the integrity of the insulation system at the end of the production line or when commissioning gas insulated switchgear and lines (GIS, GIL).Â  On the other hand, an increasing population of service aged GIS equipment has reached its originally projected lifetime. On-line partial discharge measurements utilizing
acoustic as well as UHF sensors
help keeping such equipment in service. External ring antennas, window sensors, or embedded sensors allow survey type measurements and monitoring of the partial discharge activity in the UHF range.
Acoustic measurements
offer excellent sensitivity with so-called bouncing particles. Field experience applying a compact instrument that combines the application of UHF and ultrasonic measurements is presented.

Instruments
Power Diagnostix range of instruments cover the entire needs of partial discharge testing on gas-insulated substation equipment from production testing and commissioning to maintenance and monitoring.
The
ICMcompact
is the most popular device used in test benches of switchgear manufacturers, the
ICMsystem
, the
AIAcompact
and the
ATTanalyzer
are choosen for onsite inspection and maintenance work, and the
GISmonitor
for permanent online monitoring in substations.
