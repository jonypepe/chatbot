The PAT300 series of portable appliance testers carry out all test requirements automatically with one button press and provides outstanding productivity, giving you the ability to test record numbers of appliances per hour. The PAT300 series are easily portable desktop appliance testers for testing the safety of portable electrical equipment to meet health and safety regulations.
The series is comprised of two products:
PAT320:
this is the PAT tester you need if you if you want high productivity within a tough and easy-to-use instrument. It is a fully featured tester with dedicated test buttons for direct access to tests and is ideal for those who don't require the complexity of a fully configurable database of clients and results within the tester, but do need a complete range of functions to allow automatic or manual testing of the widest range of electrical assets. If you are moving into PAT testing for the first time, or you don’t want the complexity of database management, the PAT320 is ideal for you.
PAT350:
this instrument is identical to the PAT320, with the addition of flash-test capability for use in environments such as manufacturing, production, or tool-hire shops.
In addition to automatic testing, these test instruments have the ability to run each test individually, making it particularly suited to service and repair organisations carrying out fault diagnostics.
