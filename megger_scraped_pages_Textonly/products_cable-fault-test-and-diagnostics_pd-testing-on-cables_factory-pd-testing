Factory PD Tests on Power Cables
All cables produced in a cable factory need to be tested according to the relevant quality assurance standards. During the high voltage tests a simultaneous PD measurement is recommended and applicable. Depending on the highest voltage levels under test a suitable
coupling capacitor
can be used to pick up the PD signal from the cable termination.
PD decoupling on a cable termination
The following table shows an overview of applicable standards for cables and accessories tested after production.
