The Megger PVK320 photovoltaic kit offers additional instrumentation in the form of a PVM210 irradiance meter, a CAT IV 10 A DC AVO410 multimeter, and a kit of specialist solar test leads. This kit is particularly useful for installing, commissioning, and testing photovoltaic installations and is ideal for providing extra instrumentation to accompany the usual electrician’s test equipment, such as the Megger MFT1730 and MFT1835 multifunction testers.
The PVK320 kit offers the solar/photovoltaic engineer the multimeter option of verifying, with the PVM210 irradiance meter, the stated short circuit current as provided by the manufacturer of the solar panel as required by published standards. The PVM210 is a pocket size instrument that has both solar detector and meter combined in one unit that permits single handed use, ideal for working at height and on sloping roofs.
The AVO410 multimeter features 1000 V DC / 750 V AC and 10 A AC / DC ranges. The meter has a CAT IV 600 V safety rating and true RMS readings are possible on the AC ranges. Additional functions include resistance, frequency, and capacitance
In addition to the silicon multimeter test leads supplied with the AVO410, two pairs of specialist solar test leads are included in the PVK320 kit. The first pair of leads are comprised of 1.3 m test leads terminated with standard 4 mm plugs, while the other ends are terminated with the typical PV type solar panel connector. For older style panels, a pair of conversion adaptors are provided.
To provide easy storage, the kit comes with a zipped pouch.
