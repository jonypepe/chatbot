The Smart Touch View Interface™ (STVI) is Megger’s second generation of handheld controllers for the new SMRT and older MPRT1 relay test systems. With its large, full colour, high resolution, TFT LCD touch screen, it allows you to perform manual, steady-state, and dynamic testing quickly and easily using the manual test screen, as well as using built-in preset test routines for most popular relays.
Ergonomically designed for either right or left hand operation, the STVI has rubber cushion grips and a centrally located control knob. It also has an inutitive touch screen making it extremely easy to use. You can even use the built-in stand for single-handed operation! The STVI uses a standard Ethernet cable, and Power Over Ethernet (POE) operation.
The STVI displays metered values such as AC and DC Amperes, AC and DC Volts, and time in both seconds and cycles. Depending on the type of test selected, other values may be displayed, such as phase angle, frequency, ohms, watts, VA, or power factor/dissipation factor. Menu screens and touch screen function buttons are provided to quickly and easily select the desired test function. Tests results can be saved to the STVI with its non-volatile built-in data storage, and can be downloaded to a USB drive to transfer or print test reports.
