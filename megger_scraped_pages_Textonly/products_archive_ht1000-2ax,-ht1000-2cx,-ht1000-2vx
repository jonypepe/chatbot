Overview
Vectored DSL testing for VDSL2 lines
Noise finder via a 30 MHz spectrum analyzer
7 user selectable auto tests
Incremental pair test program
200 pair pre-post test storage
AC or DC power
USB Port downloads updates and uploads test results
The HT1000/2 is a high performance, full feature, hand held instrument designed to provide copper wire provisioning and maintenance technicians with the most critical tests at the touch of a button. Durable and water resistant, the HT1000/2 is equipped with a highly effective 1/4 VGA LCD screen and a powerful backlight designed to make testing and troubleshooting easier in all work environments.
The on-screen menu launches most tests with a single keystroke.
Super Stress™ reaches beyond standard longitudinal balance testing, identifying even hard to find short loop unbalances.
Dual trace TDR is standard, with 12 trace storage and intermittent fault location.
The HT1000/2 has user selectable auto tests with an incremental pair testing process.
Test for DC and AC volts at the same time, no need to switch between separate screens.
Download updates and upload test results quickly and easily via the integrated USB port.
VECTORED DSL
Vectored DSL employs line signal coordination and noise cancellation to reduce crosstalk levels and improve line performance. Whilst using a Vectored DSL test instrument on non-vectored systems will not impinge on the test, using a non-vectored test instrument on a vectored system has a detrimental effect and can cause the system to crash. The use of a vectored DSL test instrument is essential if the installed network has vectored DSL switch and routing gear.
