Overview
Technical
Small and weighs less than 15 kg
Test currents from 10 A to 200 A DC
0.1 µΩ best resolution
On-board memory for up to 300 test results and notes
RS232 port to download stored results or for real-time output to a printer
Supplied complete with 5 m test leads and download software
The Megger DLRO200 is a 200 A micro-ohmmeter that measures resistances between 0.1 µΩ and 1 Ω at high currents. This versatile instrument can provide test currents from 10 amps up to 200 amps DC subject to the load resistance and supply voltage. The DLRO200 also uses a four-terminal measurement technique to cancel the resistance of the test leads from the measurement.
The unique design of the DLRO200 allows the weight and size to be kept to a minimum - the instrument weighs less than 15 kg. This small size makes the DLRO200 equally at home in the workshop, on the production floor, or in the field, and its high current capability and compact design make it suitable for testing circuit breaker contacts, switch contacts, busbar joints, and other applications where high current is needed.
A large LCD screen provides all the information needed to perform a test; all test parameters and measurement results are displayed. What's more, 300 sets of results may be stored in the DLRO200's on-board memory for later download to a PC or it can be output directly to a printer via the RS232 port. You may also add notes to any stored result by using the on-board alphanumeric keypad, thereby making later identification of results straightforward. Additionally, this keypad allows you to set the test current directly by typing in the value required. The DLRO200 will then check the continuity of the test circuit and will quickly ramp the test current up to the desired level. The keyboard is also used to set upper and lower limits for the result and to prevent the use of excessive currents by setting an upper limit to the allowable test current.
