Megger raises the bar for multifunction testers
Megger raises the bar for multifunction testers
Developed specifically to make installation testing safer, faster and more convenient, Megger's new and innovative
MFT1700 series instruments
set new standards for multifunction test sets.
Two wire non trip loop testing for fast repeatable results
Large bright LCD display showing dual parameters - loop resistance and fault current, insulation resistance and test voltage
Phase rotation indication for verification of rotating machinery
3-phase RCD testing for industrial applications with no earth
3-terminal earth test for electrode resistance measurement
On-board data storage and Bluetooth® download
Category IV safety
Developed specifically to make installation testing safer, faster and more convenient, Megger's new and innovative MFT1700 series instruments set new standards for multifunction test sets. The range includes three models, all of which share the same lightweight yet robust IP54 construction, large backlit display panels and timesaving features like two-wire non-trip loop testing, auto-start continuity testing and optional pass/fail RCD testing. All models in the new range have a CAT IV 300 V safety rating in line with BS EN 61010, which makes them safe to use on all areas of low voltage electrical installations. This makes it unnecessary to carry out time-consuming risk assessments to decide which instruments can be used in particular locations.
All 17th Edition functions plus
As well as the functions needed to test electrical installations in line with the 17th Edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations, high-end models in the range provide useful additional functionality. This includes facilities for checking phase rotation and testing three-phase RCDs and for measuring earth electrode resistance, something that is a common requirement in solar and other types of renewable energy installations. The entry-level instrument in the range is the MFT1710, which offers insulation testing at 250 V and 500 V, 200 mA continuity testing, RCD testing for 100 mA, 300 mA and 500 mA RCDs, and two-wire loop testing with non-trip and high-current options. In addition, this keenly priced instrument has provision for measuring voltage, frequency and, when used with a suitable probe, temperature.
On-board memory and earth electrode testing
As with all models in the range, the MFT1710 has a large display that shows not only the main test result, but also useful additional information. For example, during an insulation test, the test voltage is shown as well as the insulation resistance. The display also includes a true analogue arc, which is a big timesaver on some types of test. The MFT1720 provides all of the functions and features of the MFT1710, but adds insulation testing at 1 kV, continuity testing at 15 mA, an extended range of RCD tests including automatic RCD testing, and maximum Zs and R1 + R2 display for circuit verification. The MFT1720 also has a phase rotation feature, and facilities for testing three-phase RCDs. At the top of the range is the MFT1730, which has similar measurement capabilities to the MFT1720, but also has provision for internal storage of up to 1,000 test results. A facility for downloading the results via a Bluetooth wireless link is provided and, when used in conjunction with Megger's PowerSuite software, this allows rapid error-free preparation of test reports and certificates. When used in conjunction with the optional earth stake kit, the MFT1730 also supports earth electrode resistance testing, and it is powered by rechargeable batteries that can be recharged without removing them from the instrument.
Case designed to accomodate tools
All multifunction installation testers in Megger's new MFT1700 range are supplied in a robust carrying case that, despite its convenient size, has ample room to accommodate test leads, small tools and calibration certificates as well as the instrument itself, which can be stored in the case without the need to unplug the test leads. The testers have a three-year warranty, and are supplied as standard with a calibration certificate and a set of batteries.
