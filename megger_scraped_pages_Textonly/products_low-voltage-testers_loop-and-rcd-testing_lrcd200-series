Overview
Technical
Non-trip loop tester
RCD testing from 10 mA to 1000 mA
Extremely easy and safe to use
Built-in protective front cover
Tough rubber case
Weatherproof
3-year warranty
The Megger LRCD200 series of combined loop and RCD testers provide simple, affordable and flexible test tools for electrical contractors testing energised circuits.
All LRCD200 series instruments are supplied with a calibration certificate and come with the new Megger electricians tester case, providing tough rubber armouring, built-in front cover, weatherproof to IP54 and easy-to-use functions and layout. The instruments can be hung around the neck or hand held and will not slip if placed on a bench or shelf. Test leads can remain attached with the front cover open or closed. L-N-E connection indicator LEDs show connection status and reverse polarity supplies
Three instruments are available:
LRCD210
This instrument provides three-phase safe non-trip loop testing and 1/2I, I, and 5I RCD testing for standard, selective, and DC RCDs. Suitable for domestic installers testing to UK Part P requirements.
LRCD220
This does everything the LRCD210 does with the addition of 110 V loop testing and two-wire fast testing, plus phase-to-phase and phase-to-earth/ground measurement and automatic RCD testing with result recall. All instruments will not trip RCDs rated at 30 mA or greater during loop testing, even electronic RCDs.

LRCD200
This instrument provides three-phase safe non-trip loop testing and 1xI tests of 10 mA to 500 mA RCDs.
This instrument is not suitable for UK applications.
